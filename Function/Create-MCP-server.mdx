title: 'Develop a custom MCP server'

description: 'Create your own custom MCP Servers.'

---

**MCP servers** ([Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol)) provide a toolkit of multiple tools—individual capabilities for accessing specific APIs or databases. These servers can be interacted with using WebSocket protocol on the server’s global endpoint. 

You can **develop custom [MCP servers](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) in TypeScript** **or Python** and deploy them on Blaxel by integrating a few lines of the Blaxel SDK and leveraging our other developer tools ([Blaxel CLI](../cli-reference/introduction), GitHub action, etc.).

## Quickstart

<Warning>It is required to have *npm* (TypeScript) or *uv* (Python) installed to use the following command.</Warning>

You can quickly **initialize a new MCP server from scratch** by using CLI command `bl new`. This initializes a new pre-scaffolded local repo where your entire code can be added.

```bash
bl new mcp
```

You can test it by running the following command which launches **both** the MCP server and a web application to query it ([MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), managed by MCP) locally.

<CodeGroup>

```shell TypeScript

pnpm inspect

```

```shell Python

BL_DEBUG=true uv run mcp dev src/server.py

```

</CodeGroup>

The web application is accessible at: [http://127.0.0.1:6274](http://127.0.0.1:6274/). Alternatively, you can just simply [serve the server](Deploy-a-function) locally by running `bl serve --hotreload`.

## Develop the MCP server logic

<Accordion title="Develop in TypeScript" icon="js">

If you open the `src/server.ts` file, you'll see the complete server implementation. It follows the MCP server standard, with the only difference being **our use of Blaxel transport** that leverages WebSockets for efficient platform serving.

The main component you'll need to modify is the tool definition:

```typescript server.ts {12-25}

import { BlaxelMcpServerTransport } from "@blaxel/core";
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { StdioServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/stdio.js";
import { z } from "zod";

const server = new McpServer({
  name: "mymcp",
  version: "1.0.0",
  description: ""
});

server.tool(
  "hello_world",
  "Say hello to a person",
  {
    firstname: z.string()
  },
  async ({firstname}) => {
    console.info(`Hello world called`);
    return {
      content: [{ type: "text", text: `Hello ${firstname}` }]
    }
  }
);

function main() {
  let transport;
  if (process.env.BL_SERVER_PORT) {
    transport = new BlaxelMcpServerTransport();
  } else {
    transport = new StdioServerTransport();
  }
  server.connect(transport);
  console.info("Server started");
}

main();

```

Remember that the `name`, `description`, and *parameters* are crucial—they help your agent understand how your tool functions.

## Template directory reference

### blaxel.toml

The MCP server deployment can be configured via the ***blaxel.toml*** file in your MCP server directory. 

This file is used to configure the deployment of the MCP server on Blaxel. The only mandatory parameter is the `type` so Blaxel knows which kind of entity to deploy. Others are not mandatory but allow you to customize the deployment. 

```toml
name = "my-mcp-server"
workspace = "my-workspace"
type = "function"

[env]
DEFAULT_CITY = "San Francisco"

[[triggers]]
  id = "trigger-my-mcp"
  type = "http"
[triggers.configuration]
  path = "functions/my-mcp" # This will create this endpoint on the following base URL: https://run.blaxel.ai/{YOUR-WORKSPACE}/
  authenticationType = "public"
```

- `name`, `workspace`, and `type` fields are optional and serve as default values. Any bl command run in the folder will use these defaults rather than prompting you for input.
- `[env]` section defines environment variables that the MCP server can access via the SDK. Note that these are NOT [secrets](../Agents/Variables-and-secrets).
- `[[triggers]]`  and `[triggers.configuration]` sections defines ways to send requests to the MCP servers. You can also make them either private (default) or public (`authenticationType = "public"`).

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Define entrypoints in Python" icon="python">

Additionally, when developing in Python, you can define an `[entrypoint]` section to specify how Blaxel is going to start your server. 

```toml
...

[entrypoint]
prod = ".venv/bin/python3 src/server.py"
dev = "npx nodemon --exec uv run python src/server.py"

...
```

- `prod`:  this is the command that will be used to serve your MCP server

```bash
.venv/bin/python3 src/server.py
```

- `dev`: same as prod in dev mode, it will be used with the command `--hotreload`. Example:

```bash
npx nodemon --exec uv run python src/server.py
```

This `entrypoint` section is optional. If not specified, Blaxel will automatically detect in the MCP server’s content and configure your server’s startup settings.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Define entrypoints in TypeScript" icon="js">

In TypeScript, entrypoints are managed in the `scripts` in the `package.json` file at the root of the directory.

- `scripts.start` : start the server locally through the TypeScript command, to avoid having to build the project when developing.
- `scripts.build` : build the project. It is done automatically when deploying.
- `scripts.prod` : start the server remotely on Blaxel from the dist folder, the project needs to be have been built before.
- `scripts.dev` : same as start, but with hotreload. It's useful when developing locally, each file change is reflected immediately.

The remaining fields in *package.json* follow standard JavaScript/TypeScript project conventions. Feel free to add any dependencies you need, but keep in mind that devDependencies are only used during the build process and are removed afterwards.
