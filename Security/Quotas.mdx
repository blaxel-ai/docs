The Blaxel Console provides detailed analytics for you to monitor account usage. You can also see your account's current quotas, and request an increase in quotas if required.

## Analytics

Blaxel provides detailed cost and usage analytics at account level. These metrics are available for the current billing period, last 30 days, last 7 days, and last 24 hours.

To view usage analytics for your account:

- Click the workspace name at the bottom left of the Blaxel Console.
- Click **Account**.
- Click the **Subscription** tab.
- Navigate to the **Usage analytics** section of the page.

The usage analytics section provides details on:

- Deployment image and snapshot storage usage/cost
- Volume storage usage/cost
- Compute runtime usage/cost for sandboxes, agents, batch jobs and MCP servers
- Number/cost of asynchronous requests

You can toggle between usage and cost metrics using the switch in the top right corner of the section.

## Quotas

### Quota tiers

Blaxel has a quota tiering system that unlocks higher limits and features on the platform as your tier progresses.

Higher tiers have access to additional features, such as higher numbers of standby/concurrent sandboxes, higher number of concurrent jobs, higher sandbox and volume sizes, longer sandbox TTLs, custom domains, and more.

You can see the [limits and features of each tier](https://app.blaxel.ai/account/quotas) in the **Quotas** tab.

- Click the workspace name at the bottom left of the Blaxel Console.
- In the sub-menu, click **Account**.
- Click the **Quotas** tab.

To unlock access to [higher tiers](https://app.blaxel.ai/account/quotas), you must top up the appropriate amount of credit in your account. These top-up amounts go directly into your Blaxel wallet. This is not a fee for the tier itself, but rather a pre-payment for the usage you are about to run.

A top-up qualifies you for the selected tier for 30 days. If your usage decreases later, you naturally drop to a lower tier. A top-up does not commit you to a specific level of usage permanently.

### Quota usage

Blaxel also lets you view and manage quotas associated with your account.

Quotas for your account are listed in the **All current quotas** section

![Quotas](/images/administration/current-quotas.png)

This section provides details on quotas for:

- Deployed sandboxes, agents, MCP servers, model APIs, policies, triggers, and jobs
- Sandboxes: volumes, volume templates, default TTL, previews, volume sizes and versions
- Jobs: maximum parallel executions, maximum concurrent tasks
- Workspaces: users, service accounts, integrations, custom domains, revisions, timeouts

### Request a quota increase

It is possible to request an increase in quotas for your account through the Blaxel Console. To do this:

- Click the pencil icon.
- Input the requested quota value.

In some cases, you may see an **Upgrade** button instead of a pencil icon. Click this to access our payment gateway, in which you can provide details for payment.

Accounts on the free plan are not eligible for quota upgrades and will not see the option to request a quota increase in the Blaxel Console.
