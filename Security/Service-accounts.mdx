Service accounts are workspace users (i.e. identities) that represent an external system that needs to access Blaxel to operate resources in **one specific workspace**.

## Authentication of service accounts

### API keys

Service accounts can use [API keys](Access-tokens) to authenticate on Blaxel. These API keys can be created and managed by admins from the service account’s page, in your workspace settings.

API keys have an infinite validity duration.

### Client credentials (OAuth 2.0)

Service accounts can also use the *client credentials* [OAuth 2.0 grant type](Access-tokens), via their **client ID** and **client secret**. A pair client ID / client secret is generated automatically by Blaxel when you create a new service account.

<Warning>Make sure to copy the client secret when you create the service account as you will never be able to access it again after you leave the page.</Warning>

## Permissions of service accounts

Service accounts can have [similar permissions](Workspace-access-control) as other users from your team. These permissions are managed by admins in your workspace settings.
