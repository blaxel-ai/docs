Hey Brian! 

TLDR: I think we're on the same page on a lot of things. We've planned fine-grained access & scope for API keys for a long time, and we will implement it. It would be great to see

To answer more in depth:

We have two levels on Blaxel as you've seen: Account and Workspace.

By default, when you create your first Workspace, it creates an Account with a Free plan.

An Account has an owner, and you can add/remove admins to the Account.
That UUID you've seen is the account ID.
All payments are always account-related.

Workspaces function as "organizational units."
With a paid plan, you can have up to 5 Workspaces within an Account.
This means all consumption across an Account's Workspaces will be billed to the account (as the sum of all workspace consumption).

You can delete/create workspaces up to the limit of 5.
A Workspace is defined by two fields:

- name: Globally unique and used to link resources together (and for access). This is sometimes called "workspace's ID" in the documentation
- display_name: Just for display purposes with nothing linked to it. It's there so you can set the name you want to see in the UI

More info about the current access system:
An owner/admin of the account will have access to everything in the account: Workspaces, Billing info.
All admin/user roles inside the workspace relate only to that workspace.
An admin can do everything in a workspace.
A user has more restricted access: read access on everything + CRUD on models/agents/sandboxes/mcps

Do user roles get assigned per-workspace independently?
Yes, except for account owner/admin rightsâ€”everything else is workspace-specific.

For your environment question, there are two solutions:

- a workspace per environment
- a prefix on each resource in the same workspace

As you've seen, the main concern is access-related, and right now I would recommend a workspace per environment for maximum isolation.

- In the same workspace, a workload can access another by default (with our standard authentication system)
- You can't define fine-grained access for a workload, or for a user within a workspace
- API keys must be linked to a user or service account, and have the same access as the linked user/service account

That's what we have right now. If you need a fast first iteration, I definitely recommend using multiple workspaces.
For performing searches across elements in one or multiple workspaces, you should use an API key per workspace (in a service account). You could use a user key, but I don't recommend it.

What we have in mind and want to add in the future:

- Fine-grained access on user and service accounts, allowing you to set access for specific workloads or groups of workloads. We've implemented similar systems before, with the goal of creating something flexible, easy to use, highly scalable, and resilient.
- Scope system for our OAuth system and our API keys, which would allow giving a subset of the user/service account's access through the API key or current session.
