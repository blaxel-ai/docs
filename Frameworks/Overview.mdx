Blaxel is a fully framework-agnostic infrastructure platform that helps you build and host your agents. It supports a **range of the most popular AI agent frameworks**, optimizing how your agent builds and runs no matter how you coded it.

Blaxel's platform-agnostic design lets you deploy your code either on Blaxel or through traditional methods like Docker containers. When deploying on Blaxel, your agent goes through a specialized build process that gives it access to Blaxel features through SDK commands in its code. This low-level SDK connects you to [MCP servers](../Functions/Overview), [LLM APIs](../Models/Overview) and [other agents](../Agents/Overview) that are hosted on Blaxel.

As such, you can build your agentic applications with anything from [LangChain](LangChain) or [Vercel AI SDK](Vercel-AI) to pure TypeScript or Python, and deploy them with minimal upfront setup. Learn how to [get started with Blaxel](../Get-started) or clone one of [our example repos](https://github.com/blaxel-ai/templates/tree/main) to your favorite git provider and deploy it on Blaxel.
