description: 'Learn how to leverage Blaxel with Mastra agents.'

---

You can deploy your [Mastra](https://mastra.ai/) projects to Blaxel with minimal code editing (and zero configuration), enabling you to use [Serverless Deployments](../Infrastructure/Global-Inference-Network), [Agentic Observability](../Observability/Overview), [Policies](../Model-Governance/Policies), and more.

## Get started with Mastra on Blaxel

To get started with Mastra on Blaxel:

- if you already have a Mastra agent, adapt your code with [Blaxel SDK commands](../Agents/Develop-an-agent) to connect to [MCP servers](../Functions/Overview), [LLMs](../Models/Overview) and [other agents](../Agents/Overview).
- else initialize an example project in Mastra by using the following Blaxel CLI command and selecting the *Mastra hello world:*

```bash
bl create-agent-app myagent
```

[Deploy](../Agents/Deploy-an-agent) it by running:

```bash
bl deploy
```

## Develop a Mastra agent using Blaxel features

While building your agent in Mastra, use Blaxel [SDK](../sdk-reference/introduction) to connect to resources already hosted on Blaxel:

- [MCP servers](../Functions/Overview)
- [LLMs](../Models/Overview)
- [other agents](../Agents/Overview)

### Connect to MCP servers

Connect to [MCP servers](../Functions/Overview) using the Blaxel SDK to access pre-built or custom tool servers hosted on Blaxel. This eliminates the need to manage server connections yourself, with credentials stored securely on the platform.

Run the following command to retrieve tools in Mastra format:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript

import { blTools } from '@blaxel/mastra';

const tools = await blTools(['mcp-server-name'])

```

</CodeGroup>

### Connect to LLMs

Connect to [LLMs](../Models/Overview) hosted on Blaxel using the SDK to avoid managing model API connections yourself. All credentials remain securely stored on the platform.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript

import { blModel } from "@blaxel/mastra";

const model = await blModel("model-api-name");

```

</CodeGroup>

### Connect to other agents

Connect to other agents hosted on Blaxel from your code by using the [Blaxel SDK](../sdk-reference/introduction). This allows for multi-agent chaining without managing connections yourself. This command is independent of the framework used to build the agent.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript

import { blAgent } from "@blaxel/core";

const myAgentResponse = await blAgent("agent-name").run(input);

```

</CodeGroup>

### Host your agent on Blaxel

You can [deploy](../Agents/Deploy-an-agent) your agent on Blaxel, enabling you to use [Serverless Deployments](../Infrastructure/Global-Inference-Network), [Agentic Observability](../Observability/Overview), [Policies](../Model-Governance/Policies), and more. This command is independent of the framework used to build the agent.

Either run the following CLI command from the root of your agent repository.

```bash
bl deploy
```

Or [connect a GitHub repository to Blaxel](../Agents/Github-integration) for automatic deployments every time you push on *main*.
