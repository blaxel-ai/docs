## Retrieve agent information

To use this integration, you'll need:

- the inference endpoint for the agent you want to connect
- an API key that has access to this agent

First, [deploy an agent](../Agents/Deploy-an-agent) on Blaxel (formerly Beamlit). Once the agent is deployed, retrieve its [inference endpoint](../Agents/Query-agents).

You will need an API key to query the agent externally. Follow [this guide to create a service account in your workspace and generate an API key](../Security/Service-accounts).

## Connect your agent on Pactory

To connect your agent to your Pactory account, open your Pactory dashboard, then go to “**Add New Agent**” and select “**Beamlit**”

Fill in the standard agent configuration fields (name, description, etc.). Then, enter your Blaxel-specific configuration:

- LLM Completions Endpoint: inference endpoint of your Blaxel agent
- LLM Completion API key: service account’s API key

Publish and turn on your agent using the button in the actions section of the agent. Send a test message to verify the integration is working properly. Share your agent and get paid based on usage.
