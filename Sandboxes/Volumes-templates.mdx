<Warning>Blaxel Volumes and Volume Templates are currently in private preview. Please [contact us](https://blaxel.ai/contact?message=I+would+like+to+get+access+to+volumes+because+&purpose=volumes&origin=docs) if you would like to get access before the public release date.</Warning>

Volume templates let you create **pre-populated [volumes](Volumes) with files and directories**, improving copy performance by up to 90% compared to `cp -r`. Use them to build development environments with pre-installed dependencies, datasets, or application code.

## Create a volume template

### Initialize a new template

To create a new volume template, use the following command:

```bash
bl new volume-template mytemplate
```

This creates a folder named `mytemplate` containing a `blaxel.toml` file with the following configuration:

```toml
type = "volume-template"
directory = "."          # Root of your volume - everything at and below this level will be copied
defaultSize = 2048       # Default size in MB for volumes created from this template
```

The `directory` field specifies which folder’s contents will be included in the template:
- `"."` (default) - Includes everything in the template folder
- `"app"` - Includes only files inside the `app` subdirectory
- `"src/data"` - Includes only files inside the `src/data` subdirectory

For example, if you want to include only your application code without configuration files:

```toml
type = "volume-template"
directory = "app"        # Only files inside the 'app' folder will be copied
defaultSize = 2048
```

### Deploy a volume template

Deploy your volume template to make it available for creating other volumes:

```bash
bl deploy
```

To preview the deployment without making changes:

```bash
bl deploy --dryrun
```

Each deployment creates a new revision of your template. Revisions are auto-incremented and versioned for rollback capabilities.

## Use volume templates

Once deployed, you can create volumes from your template:

```tsx
const volume = await VolumeInstance.createIfNotExists({
  name: "myvolume",
  template: "mytemplate:1"  // Use template-name:revision or template-name:latest
});
```

Override the default volume size if needed:

```tsx
// Example with a custom size
const volume = await VolumeInstance.createIfNotExists({
  name: "myvolume",
  template: "mytemplate:latest",
  size: 4096  // Override the default size if needed
});
```

Template revisions are incremental and auto-generated. The system maintains a limited number of versions for each template.

## Manage volume templates

List all available templates in your workspace:

```bash
bl get volumetemplates
```

View details of a specific template, including size requirements:

```bash
bl get volumetemplate mytemplate
```

### Size constraints

Volumes must be provisioned with sufficient space for the template content. If a volume is smaller than the template data, creation will fail with an error.

Always add a delta (extra space) to your volume size beyond the template content size. This ensures you can add files to the volume after it’s attached to a sandbox. We recommend provisioning at least 20-30% extra space.

To check your template directory size before deployment:

```bash
du -sh mytemplate
```

For example, if your template is 1.5GB, create volumes with at least 2GB of space:

```tsx
const volume = await VolumeInstance.createIfNotExists({
  name: "myvolume",
  template: "mytemplate:latest",
  size: 2048  // 2GB for a 1.5GB template - leaves 500MB for new files
});
```

This helps you set an appropriate `defaultSize` in your `blaxel.toml` or specify the correct size when creating volumes.

### Delete a template

To delete a volume template and all its associated revisions:

```bash
bl delete volumetemplate mytemplate
```

Deleting a template does not affect existing volumes created from that template. However, you won’t be able to create new volumes from deleted templates.

## **Limitations**

Volume templates **do not handle symlinks or hardlinks**, which may cause unexpected behavior. In addition, symlinks pointing outside the template (for example, `symlink -> /etc/hosts`) are explicitly forbidden. In these cases, use a copy instead.

As a result, using package managers like `pnpm` or `uv` may also behave unexpectedly if dependencies are vendored within the template.
