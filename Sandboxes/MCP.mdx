Every sandbox is exposed via an MCP server that allows agents to **operate a sandbox using tool calls.**

## Connect to the MCP server

The MCP server operates through streamable HTTP at the sandbox's base URL:

```
https://<SANDBOX_BASE_URL>/mcp
```

<Warning>
Blaxel has replaced its WebSockets implementation for MCP transport with streamable HTTP (as of November 2025). Blaxel will continue to temporarily support WebSockets for a transition period, but users should update their deployments to the streamable HTTP transport as soon as possible to avoid errors.
</Warning>

Connect to this MCP server [like any other MCP server](../Functions/Invoke-functions) though the endpoint shown above. Instructions for some popular applications are provided below.

<Note>
You must provide your [Blaxel API key](../Security) in the `Authorization` header. If your user has access to multiple workspaces, include the workspace header as well.

- Required: `Authorization: Bearer <APIKEY>`
- Optional (multi-workspace): `X-Blaxel-Workspace: <WORKSPACE_NAME_OR_ID>`

</Note>

### Add to Cursor

Add the server to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "blaxel": {
      "url": "https://<SANDBOX_BASE_URL>/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <APIKEY>",
        "X-Blaxel-Workspace": "<OPTIONAL_WORKSPACE>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Add to Claude Code

[Add the remote HTTP server to your Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp#option-3%3A-add-a-remote-http-server) by running the following command:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http blaxel https://<SANDBOX_BASE_URL>/mcp \\
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <APIKEY>" \\
  --header "X-Blaxel-Workspace: <OPTIONAL_WORKSPACE>"
```

### Add to Windsurf

Add to `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "blaxel": {
      "url": "https://<SANDBOX_BASE_URL>/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <APIKEY>",
        "X-Blaxel-Workspace": "<OPTIONAL_WORKSPACE>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Add to Goose

Add to `~/.config/goose/config.yaml`:

```yaml
extensions:
  sandbox-mcp:
    enabled: true
    type: streamable_http
    name: sandbox-mcp
    description: Sandbox MCP
    uri: https://<SANDBOX_BASE_URL>/mcp
    envs: {}
    env_keys: []
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer <APIKEY>
      X-Blaxel-Workspace: <OPTIONAL_WORKSPACE>
    timeout: 300
    bundled: null
    available_tools: []
```

## Tools available in the MCP server

1. Process management:
    1. `processExecute` - Execute a command.
    2. `processGet` - Get process information by identifier (PID or name).
    3. `processGetLogs` - Get logs for a specific process.
    4. `processKill` - Kill a specific process.
    5. `processStop` - Stop a specific process.
    6. `processesList` - List all running processes.
2. Filesystem operations
    1. `fsDeleteFileOrDirectory` - Delete a file or directory.
    2. `fsGetWorkingDirectory` - Get the current working directory.
    3. `fsListDirectory` - List contents of a directory.
    4. `fsReadFile` - Read contents of a file.
    5. `fsWriteFile` - Create or update a file.
3. Tools specialized for code generation AI:
    1. `codegenEditFile` - Propose and apply a targeted edit to a specified file, with instructions and partial contents. This tool uses [Morph](https://morphllm.com/) or [Relace](https://relace.ai/) for fast edits, and requires the corresponding API key set as an environment variable when creating the sandbox.
    2. `codegenCodebaseSearch` - Find semantic code snippets from the codebase based on a natural language query.
    3. `codegenFileSearch` - Fast fuzzy filename search in the project.
    4. `codegenGrepSearch` - Run fast, exact regex/text searches on files for locating patterns or strings.
    5. `codegenListDir` - List contents of a directory in the project.
    6. `codegenParallelApply` - Plan and apply similar changes to multiple locations/files simultaneously.
    7. `codegenReadFileRange` - Read a specific range of lines in a file (max 250 lines at once).
    8. `codegenReapply` - Retry the application of the last edit, in case it previously failed.

Using Blaxel SDK, you can retrieve the tools for a sandbox in any supported framework format by passing the sandbox’s name. For example, in LangGraph:

<CodeGroup>
```typescript TypeScript
import { blTools } from "@blaxel/vercel";

const tools = await blTools([`sandbox/${sandboxName}`])
```

```python Python
from blaxel.langgraph import bl_tools

tools = await bl_tools([f"sandbox/{sandbox_name}"])
```
</CodeGroup>
