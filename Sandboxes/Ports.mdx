title: 'Ports'

description: 'Expose specific ports on your sandbox and connect to them.'

---

Your sandbox, just like any virtual machine, can **expose ports**. These ports let you connect to a process or app running in the sandbox.

## Reserved ports

The following ports are reserved by Blaxel's system:

- **443**: This port hosts the main [sandbox API](https://docs.blaxel.ai/api-reference/filesystem/get-file-or-directory-information) and is exposed via HTTPS
- **80**: Reserved for system operations
- **8080**: Reserved for sandbox API functionality

You can expose and use any other port on your sandbox.

## Expose a port

<Note>
To whitelist sandbox traffic in your network, you can [retrieve the public IP addresses](/Infrastructure/Regions#public-ip-addresses) used by Blaxel.
</Note>

You can expose specific non-reserved ports [**when creating a new sandbox**](Overview) by using the `ports` parameter. This allows you to access these ports from outside the sandbox, typically to create a [preview URL](Preview-url) on them.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript {8}
import { SandboxInstance } from "@blaxel/core";

// Create a new sandbox
const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.create({
  name: "my-sandbox",
  image: "blaxel/base-image:latest",
  memory: 4096,
  ports: [{ target: 3000 }]
});
```

```python Python {8}
from blaxel.core import SandboxInstance

# Create a new sandbox
sandbox = await SandboxInstance.create({
  "name": "my-sandbox",
  "image": "blaxel/base-image:latest",
  "memory": 4096,
  "ports": [{ "target": 3000 }]
})
```

## Access the sandbox on a specific port

### Via the sandbox API

This option requires your request to be [authenticated](../Security/Access-tokens). You can access your sandbox on a specific port through the sandbox API using the following URL format:

```
https://sbx-{resource_name}-{workspace_id}.{region_id}.bl.run/port/{port_number}
```

For example to connect to port 3000 on `my-sandbox` in workspace `abc123`: `https://sbx-my-sandbox-abc123.us-pdx-1.bl.run/port/3000`

### Via a preview URL

[Preview URLs](Preview-url) provide a simple URL that maps to an internal port of your sandbox. You can either make this URL fully public or secure it with token-based authentication.

Generally speaking:

- for file and process management in your sandbox, use the sandbox API or SDK.
- to access running applications within the sandbox *(such as a NextJS preview server on port 3000)*, use a preview URL instead.

### Via SDK

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
import { SandboxInstance } from "@blaxel/core";

// Connect to existing sandbox
const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.get("my-sandbox")

// Get URL for port access
const url = `${sandbox.metadata.url}/port/${portNumber}`
```

```python Python
from blaxel.core import SandboxInstance

# Connect to existing sandbox
sandbox = await SandboxInstance.get("my-sandbox")

# Get URL for port access
url = f"{sandbox.metadata.url}/port/{port_number}"
```
