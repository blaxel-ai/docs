title: 'Manage ports on your sandbox'

description: 'Expose specific ports on your sandbox and learn the methods to connect to them.'

---

Your sandbox, just like any virtual machine, can **expose ports**. These ports let you connect to a process or app running in the sandbox. 

## Reserved ports

The following ports are reserved by Blaxel's system:

- **443**: This port hosts the main [sandbox API](https://docs.blaxel.ai/api-reference/filesystem/get-file-or-directory-information) and is exposed via HTTPS
- **80**: Reserved for system operations
- **8080**: Reserved for sandbox API functionality

You can expose and use any other port on your sandbox.

## Expose a port

You can expose specific non-reserved ports [**when creating a new sandbox**](Overview) by using the `ports` parameter.

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript {8}
import { SandboxInstance } from "@blaxel/core";

// Create a new sandbox
const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.create({
  name: "my-sandbox",
  image: "blaxel/prod-base:latest",
  memory: 4096,
  ports: [{ target: 3000 }]
});
```

```python Python {8}
from blaxel.core import SandboxInstance

# Create a new sandbox
sandbox = await SandboxInstance.create({
  "name": "my-sandbox",
  "image": "blaxel/prod-base:latest",
  "memory": 4096,
  "ports": [{ "target": 3000 }]
})
```

</CodeGroup>

## Access the sandbox on a specific port

### Via the sandbox API

This option requires your request to be [authenticated](../Security/Access-tokens). You can access your sandbox on a specific port through the sandbox API using the following URL format:

```
https://run.blaxel.ai/{workspace_id}/sandboxes/{sandbox_id}/port/{port_number}
```

For example to connect to port 3000 on my-sandbox: `https://run.blaxel.ai/my-workspace/sandboxes/my-sandbox/port/3000`

### Via a preview URL

[Preview URLs](Preview-url) provide a simple URL that maps to an internal port of your sandbox. You can either make this URL fully public or secure it with token-based authentication.

Generally speaking:

- for file and process management in your sandbox, use the sandbox API or SDK.
- to access running applications within the sandbox *(such as a NextJS preview server on port 3000)*, use a preview URL instead.
