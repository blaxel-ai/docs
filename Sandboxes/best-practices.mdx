Unlike traditional sandbox providers, Blaxel Sandboxes automatically scale up and down at near-instant speeds. As such, here are some recommended best practices:

# Use the sandbox lifecycle strategically

If the end-user or agent is expected to continue a session soon, just leave the sandbox as is. It will automatically suspend when the connection closes (= you will stop paying for compute runtime) and resume when reconnected.

<Note>
  The definition of "soon" is at your discretion. It's a tradeoff between instant resume times from standby mode (~25ms) and paying for the [standby snapshot storage cost](https://blaxel.ai/pricing). As a rule of thumb, most customers keep sandboxes in standby for a few hours to a few days.
</Note>

# Use volumes for persistent data

Blaxel doesn't limit how long a sandbox can stay in standby mode, but doesn't guarantee data persistence. For guaranteed long-term data persistence, use [volumes](./Volumes).

<Note>
  If you persist data in a volume, you can delete the sandbox. To resume a session, you'll need to re-create the sandbox (~400–600ms) and restart processes to restore the same state.
</Note>

# Set sandbox TTLs

For automatic cleanup, set [TTLs](../Sandboxes/Expiration) when creating your sandbox to delete it after a set idle duration or maximum age.
