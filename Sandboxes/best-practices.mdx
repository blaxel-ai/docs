Unlike traditional sandbox providers, Blaxel Sandboxes automatically scale up and down at near-instant speeds, and persist forever in standby. As such, here are some recommended best practices so you can best make use of the platform features.

## Use the sandbox lifecycle strategically

**Treat sandboxes as** **persistent computers**, rather than thinking of them as ephemeral runtimes that must be wiped clean after every interaction. Just as your laptop isn't reformatted every time you close the lid, you shouldn't destroy a sandbox's state simply because a session ended. Blaxel Sandboxes are designed to maintain persistent storage and system state, allowing agents to retain context, shell history, and installed dependencies indefinitely.

The most efficient way to manage lifecycle is to let the sandbox suspend automatically when idle, rather than explicitly destroying it. Auto-suspend happens automatically after 15s inactivity. Resuming a standby sandbox is orders of magnitude faster than cold-booting a new box and re-running setup scripts (like `npm install` or `apt-get`). By relying on suspension, you ensure that when an agent returns (whether in ten minutes or ten weeks) the environment is restored exactly as it was left, enabling a seamless instant resume experience that saves both time and compute costs.

<Note>
  The definition of a session is at your discretion. It's a tradeoff between instant resume times from standby mode (~25ms) and paying for the [standby snapshot storage cost](https://blaxel.ai/pricing). As a rule of thumb, most customers keep sandboxes in standby for 7-60 days -- see down below.

## Use volumes for data durability

The sandbox's root filesystem is like your laptop's local SSD. While it's very fast and retains data during suspension, it isn't strictly guaranteed against long-term risks (e.g. if you spill coffee on your computer). **For data that must survive indefinitely, use **[**Volumes**](./Volumes)**.**

Think of Volumes as redundant external hard drives. They are decoupled from the compute hardware, meaning they exist independently of the sandbox. Blaxel ensures high redundancy on these volumes, making them the correct choice for critical user data, databases, or project files that need to be accessed by multiple different agents.

However, relying solely on volumes for state management comes with a trade-off. If you delete a sandbox and rely on re-attaching a volume to a new one, you lose the "instant resume" benefit of the previous section. You will incur a ~400–600ms cold-boot penalty to create the new sandbox and will need to restart your processes. Use volumes for safety, but rely on sandbox suspension for speed.

## Automate cleanup with TTLs

While we advocate for treating sandboxes as perpetual computers, not every machine needs to last forever. In production, you will inevitably accumulate a long tail of sandboxes that will never be called upon again (e.g., completed tasks, abandoned user sessions). To prevent digital clutter and unnecessary storage usage, you need automated garbage collection.

Use [lifecycle policies and time-to-live (TTL)](../Sandboxes/Expiration) settings to define exactly when a computer should be retired. You can configure this based on idle duration (_e.g., delete if it hasn't been active for 7 days_) or absolute maximum age (_e.g., delete after 30 days_).
