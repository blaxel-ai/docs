description: 'Run any custom AI agent on Blaxel.'

---

You can **develop agents using any framework** — such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, VercelAI, or any custom framework — and deploy them on Blaxel by integrating a few lines of the Blaxel SDK and leveraging our other developer tools ([Blaxel CLI](../cli-reference/introduction), GitHub action, etc.).

The [Blaxel SDK](../sdk-reference/introduction) allows you to connect to and orchestrate Blaxel resources when developing your agents, such as: model APIs, tool servers, sandboxes, batch jobs, or other agents. It also ensures telemetry, secure connections to third-party systems or private networks and smart global placement of workflows.

This packaging makes Blaxel **fully agnostic of the framework** used to develop your agent and doesn’t prevent you from deploying your software on another platform.

## Overview of the development/deployment process

Blaxel’s development paradigm is designed to have a minimal footprint on your usual development process. Your custom code remains platform-agnostic: you can deploy it on Blaxel or through traditional methods like Docker containers on VMs or Kubernetes clusters. When you deploy on Blaxel (CLI command `bl deploy`), Blaxel runs a specialized build process that integrates your code with its [Global Agentics Network](../Infrastructure/Global-Inference-Network) features.

<Warning>At this time, Blaxel only supports custom agents developed in TypeScript or Python.</Warning>

Here is a high-level presentation of how agents can be built and deployed using Blaxel:

1. **Initialize a new project by creating a local git repository**. This will contain your agent's logic, custom functions, and API connections, as well as all required dependencies. For quick setup, use [Blaxel CLI](../cli-reference/introduction) command `bl create-agent-app`, which creates a pre-scaffolded local repository ready for developing and deploying your agent on Blaxel.
2. **Develop and test your agent iteratively in a local environment**. 
    1. Develop your agent logic using an agentic framework (like LangChain or Vercel AI) or any custom TypeScript/Python code. Write your own functions as needed. Use Blaxel SDK commands to connect to resources from Blaxel such as model APIs and tool servers.
    2. Use Blaxel CLI command `bl serve` to serve your agent on your local machine and get an endpoint for inference requests. The execution workflow—including agent logic, functions, and model API calls—is broken down and sandboxed exactly as it would be when served on Blaxel.
3. **Deploy your agent**. Use Blaxel CLI command `bl deploy` to build and deploy your agent on Blaxel. You can manage a development & production life-cycle by deploying multiple agents, with the according prefix or label.
