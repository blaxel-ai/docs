title: 'Develop agents in Python'

description: 'Use the Blaxel SDK to develop and run a custom agent in Python.'

---

You can bring your **custom agents developed in Python** and deploy them to Blaxel with our developer tools ([Blaxel CLI](../cli-reference/introduction), [GitHub app](Github-integration), GitHub action, etc.). You can develop agents using frameworks like LangChain, Google ADK, OpenAI Agents SDK; or your own custom code.

### Quickstart

<Warning>It is required to [have *uv* installed](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) to use the following command.</Warning>

You can quickly **initialize a new project from scratch** by using CLI command `bl create-agent-app`. 

```bash
bl create-agent-app myagent
```

This will create a pre-scaffolded local repo where your entire code can be added. You can choose the base agentic framework for the template.

In the generated folder, you'll find a standard server in the entrypoint file `main.py`. While you typically won't need to modify this file, you can add specific logic there if needed. Your main work will focus on the `agent.py` file. Blaxel's development paradigm lets you leverage its hosting capabilities without modifying your agent's core logic.

### Requirements & limitations

Agents Hosting have few requirements or limitations:

- The only requirement to deploy an app on Agents Hosting is that it exposes an HTTP API server which is bound on `BL_SERVER_HOST` (for the host) and `BL_SERVER_PORT` (for the port). **These two environment variables are required for the host+port combo.**
    - You can use [express](https://expressjs.com/), [fastify](https://fastify.dev/), [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), etc. for this.

- Deployed agents have a runtime limit after which executions time out. This timeout duration is determined by your chosen [infrastructure generation](../Infrastructure/Gens). For Mk 2 generation, the **maximum timeout is 10 minutes**.

- The synchronous endpoint has a timeout of **100 seconds** for keeping the connection open when no data flows through the API. If your agent streams back responses, the 100-second timeout resets with each chunk streamed. For example, if your agent processes a request for 5 minutes while streaming data, the connection stays open. However, if it goes 100 seconds without sending any data — even while calling external APIs — the connection will timeout.

## Accessing resources with Blaxel SDK

[Blaxel SDK](../sdk-reference/introduction) provides methods to programmatically access and integrate various resources hosted on Blaxel into your agent's code, such as: [model APIs](../Models/Overview), [tool servers](../Functions/Overview), [sandboxes](../Sandboxes/Overview), [batch jobs](../Jobs/Overview), or [other agents](Overview). The SDK handles authentication, secure connection management and telemetry automatically.

### Connect to a model API

Blaxel SDK provides a helper to connect to a [model API](../Models/Overview) defined on Blaxel from your code. This allows you to avoid managing a connection with the model API by yourself. Credentials remain stored securely on Blaxel.

```python
from blaxel.{FRAMEWORK_NAME} import bl_model

model = await bl_model("Model-name-on-Blaxel");
```

The model is automatically converted to your chosen framework's format based on the `FRAMEWORK_NAME` specified in the import.

Available frameworks :

- [LangGraph/LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models/) : `langgraph`
- [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/llms) : `crewai`
- [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/models/llms/) : `llamaindex()`
- [OpenAI Agents](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python): `openai()`
- [Pydantic AI Agents](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai): `pydantic()`
- [Google ADK](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/models/lite_llm.py): `googleadk()`

For example, to connect to model `my-model` in a *LlamaIndex* agent:

```python
from blaxel.llamaindex import bl_model

model = await bl_model("my-model")
```

### Connect to tools

Blaxel SDK provides a helper to connect to [pre-built or custom tool servers (MCP servers)](../Functions/Overview) hosted on Blaxel from your code. This allows you to avoid managing a connection with the server by yourself. Credentials remain stored securely on Blaxel. The following method retrieves all the tools discoverable in the tool server.

```python
from blaxel.{FRAMEWORK_NAME} import bl_tools

await bl_tools(['Tool-Server-name-on-Blaxel'])
```

Like for a model, the retrieved tools are automatically converted to the format of the framework you want to use based on the Blaxel SDK package imported. Available frameworks are `langgraph` ([LangGraph/Langchain](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/tools/langchain_core.tools.structured.StructuredTool.html)), `llamaindex` ([LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/deploying/agents/tools/)), `crewai` ([CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/concepts/tools)), `openai` ([OpenAI Agents](https://github.com/openai/openai-agents-python)), `pydantic` ([PydanticAI Agents](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai)) and `googleadk` ([Google ADK](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/tools/base_tool.py)).

You can develop agents by **mixing tools defined locally in your agents, and tools defined as remote servers**. Using separated tools prevents monolithic designs which make maintenance easier in the long run. Let's look at a practical example combining remote and local tools. The code below uses two tools:

1. `blaxel-search`: A remote tool server on Blaxel providing web search functionality (learn how to create your own MCP servers [here](../Functions/Create-MCP-server))
2. `weather`: A local tool that accepts a city parameter and returns a mock weather response (always "sunny")

### Connect to another agent (multi-agent chaining)

Rather than using a "quick and dirty" approach where you would combine all your agents and capabilities into a single deployment, Blaxel provides a structured development paradigm based on two key principles:

- Agents can grow significantly in complexity. Monolithic architectures make long-term maintenance difficult.
- Individual agents should be reusable across multiple projects.

Blaxel supports a microservice architecture for handoffs, allowing you to call one agent from another using `bl_agent().run()` rather than combining all functionality into a single codebase.

```bash
from blaxel.core.agents import bl_agent

first_agent_response = await bl_agent("first_agent").run(input);
second_agent_response = await bl_agent("second_agent").run(first_agent_response);
```

## Customize the agent deployment

You can set custom parameters for an agent deployment (e.g. specify the agent name, etc.) in the `blaxel.toml` file at the root of your directory. 

Read the file structure section down below for more details.

## Instrumentation

Instrumentation happens automatically when workloads run on Blaxel. To enable telemetry, simply require the SDK in your project's entry point.

```bash
import blaxel.core
```

When agents and tools are deployed on Blaxel, request logging and tracing happens automatically.

To add your own custom logs that you can view in the Blaxel Console, use the Python default logger.

```bash
import logging

logger = getLogger(__name__)
logger.info("Hello, world!");
```

## Template directory reference

### Overview

```bash
pyproject.toml          # Mandatory. This file is the standard pyproject.toml file, it defines dependencies.
blaxel.toml             # This file lists configurations dedicated to Blaxel to customize the deployment. It is not mandatory.
.blaxel                 # This folder allows you to define custom resources using the Blaxel API specifications. These resources will be deployed along with your agent.
├── blaxel-search.yaml  # Here, blaxel-search is a sandbox Web search tool we provide so you can develop your first agent. It has a low rate limit, so we recommend you use a dedicated MCP server for production.
src/
└── main.py             # This file is the standard entrypoint of the project. It is used to start the server and create an endpoint bound with agent.py file.
├── agent.py            # This file is the main file of your agent. It is loaded from main.py. In the template, all the agent logic is implemented here.
```

### blaxel.toml

This file is used to configure the deployment of the agent on Blaxel. The only mandatory parameter is the `type` so Blaxel knows which kind of entity to deploy. Others are not mandatory but allow you to customize the deployment. 

```toml
name = "my-agent"
workspace = "my-workspace"
type = "agent"

agents = []
functions = ["blaxel-search"]
models = ["gpt-4o-mini"]

[env]
DEFAULT_CITY = "San Francisco"

[runtime]
timeout = 900
memory = 1024

[[triggers]]
  id = "trigger-async-my-agent"
  type = "http-async"
[triggers.configuration]
  path = "agents/my-agent/async" # This will create this endpoint on the following base URL: https://run.blaxel.ai/{YOUR-WORKSPACE} 
  retry = 1

[[triggers]]
  id = "trigger-my-agent"
  type = "http"
[triggers.configuration]
  path = "agents/my-agent/sync"
  retry = 1
  authenticationType = "public"
```

- `name`, `workspace`, and `type` fields are optional and serve as default values. Any bl command run in the folder will use these defaults rather than prompting you for input.
- `agents`, `functions`, and `models` fields are also optional. They specify which resources to deploy with the agent. These resources are preloaded during build, eliminating runtime dependencies on the Blaxel control plane and dramatically improving performance.
- `[env]` section defines environment variables that the agent can access via the SDK. Note that these are NOT [secrets](Variables-and-secrets).
- `[runtime]` section allows to override agent deployment parameters: timeout (in s) or memory (in MB) to allocate.
- `[[triggers]]`  and `[triggers.configuration]` sections defines ways to send requests to the agent. You can create both [synchronous and asynchronous](Query-agents) trigger endpoints (respectively `type = "http"` or `type = "http-async"`). You can also make them either private (default) or public (`authenticationType = "public"`). 
A private synchronous HTTP endpoint is always created by default, even if you don’t define any trigger here.

Additionally, you can define an `[entrypoint]` section to specify how Blaxel is going to start your server:

```toml
...

[entrypoint]
prod = "python src/main.py"
dev = "fastapi dev"

...
```

- `prod`:  this is the command that will be used to serve your agent

```bash
python src/main.py
```

- `dev`: same as prod in dev mode, it will be used with the command `--hotreload`. Example:

```bash
fastapi dev
```

This `entrypoint` section is optional. If not specified, Blaxel will automatically detect in the agent’s content and configure your agent startup settings.

## Troubleshooting

### Wrong port or host

```
Default STARTUP TCP probe failed 1 time consecutively for container "agent" on port 80. The instance was not started.
Connection failed with status DEADLINE_EXCEEDED.
```

If you encounter this error when deploying your agent on Blaxel, ensure that your agent properly exposes an API server that binds to a host and port with the **required** environment variables: `BL_SERVER_HOST` & `BL_SERVER_PORT`. Blaxel automatically injects these variables during deployment.
