Blaxel Agents Hosting lets you bring your agent code **and deploys it as a serverless auto-scalable endpoint** — no matter your development framework. 

Follow these steps to get your AI agent up and running on Blaxel.

## 1. Create configuration files

At the root of your project repository, create a `blaxel.toml` file for configuration, and a `.env` file for your sensitive [environment variables](Variables-and-secrets).

**Example `blaxel.toml`:**

```toml
type = "agent"

[runtime]
generation = "mk3"
memory = 4096

[env]
MY_NON_SENSITIVE_ENV = "MY_NON_SENSITIVE_ENV"
```

## 2. Update host and port in your code

Ensure your app listens on the host and port provided by Blaxel. Update your code accordingly:

```jsx
const port = parseInt(process.env.BL_SERVER_PORT || "80");
const host = process.env.BL_SERVER_HOST || "0.0.0.0";
```

## 3. Deploy your agent

When deploying, there are two possible scenarios:

### Option A: You already have a `Dockerfile`

Blaxel will automatically use it to build your agent. Just run:

```bash
bl deploy
```

### Option B: No `Dockerfile`

If you don’t want to create one, add the following scripts to your `package.json`.

Depending of what you do, all of the `scripts` are not required. With TypeScript, all 4 of them are used.

- `start` : start the server locally through the TypeScript command, to avoid having to build the project when developing.
- `build` : build the project. It is done automatically when deploying.
- `prod` : start the server remotely from the dist folder, the project needs to be have been built before.
- `dev` : same as start, but with hotreload. It's useful when developing locally, each file change is reflected immediately.

The remaining fields in package.json follow standard JavaScript/TypeScript project conventions. Feel free to add any dependencies you need, but keep in mind that devDependencies are only used during the build process and are removed afterwards.

```json
{
  "name": "name",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "<no value>",
  "keywords": [],
  "license": "MIT",
  "author": "cdrappier",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "tsx src/index.ts",
    "prod": "node dist/index.js",
    "dev": "tsx watch src/index.ts",
    "build": "tsc"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "@ai-sdk/openai": "^1.2.5",
    "@blaxel/sdk": "0.1.1-preview.9",
    "ai": "^4.1.61",
    "fastify": "^5.2.1",
    "zod": "^3.24.2"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "@types/express": "^5.0.1",
    "@types/node": "^22.13.11",
    "tsx": "^4.19.3",
    "typescript": "^5.8.2"
  }
}
```

Then run:

```bash
bl deploy
```

## 4. (Optional) Enable telemetry

Instrumentation happens automatically when workloads run on Blaxel. To enable telemetry, simply import the SDK in your project's entry point.

**For TypeScript:**

```tsx
import "@blaxel/telemetry";
```

**For Python:**

```bash
import blaxel.core
```

## 5. (Optional) Run locally with Blaxel CLI

If you want to run your agent locally and start using the SDK, make sure the `start` and `dev` scripts are defined, then run:

```bash
bl serve
# or
bl serve --hotreload
```

That’s it! You’re ready to start integrating Blaxel features using the Blaxel SDK.
