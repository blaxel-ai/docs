Blaxel Agents Hosting lets you bring your agent code **and deploys it as a serverless auto-scalable endpoint** — no matter your development framework. 

Follow these steps to get your AI agent up and running on Blaxel.

## 1. Create configuration files

At the root of your project repository, create a `blaxel.toml` file and a `.env` file for your sensitive environment variables.

**Example `blaxel.toml`:**

```toml
type = "agent"

[runtime]
generation = "mk3"
memory = 4096

[env]
MY_NON_SENSITIVE_ENV = "MY_NON_SENSITIVE_ENV"
```

## 2. Update host and port in your code

Ensure your app listens on the host and port provided by Blaxel. Update your code accordingly:

```jsx
const port = parseInt(process.env.BL_SERVER_PORT || "80");
const host = process.env.BL_SERVER_HOST || "0.0.0.0";
```

## 3. Deploy your agent

When deploying, there are two possible scenarios:

### Option A: You already have a `Dockerfile`

Blaxel will automatically use it to build your agent. Just run:

```bash
bl deploy
```

### Option B: No `Dockerfile`

If you don’t want to create one, add the following scripts to your `package.json`:

> Depending on your setup, not all scripts are required. For TypeScript projects, all four are commonly used.
> 
- **`start`**: Runs the server locally via TypeScript without needing a build step (useful for dev).
- **`build`**: Builds the project (triggered automatically during deployment).
- **`prod`**: Starts the server in production from the `dist` folder (requires a build first).
- **`dev`**: Same as `start`, but with hot-reload for instant updates while developing.

Then run:

```bash
bl deploy
```

## 4. (Optional) Enable telemetry

If you need telemetry, just import it in your app’s entrypoint:

```jsx
import "@blaxel/telemetry";
```

## 5. (Optional) Run locally with Blaxel CLI

If you want to run your agent locally and start using the SDK, make sure the `start` and `dev` scripts are defined, then run:

```bash
bl serve
# or
bl serve --hotreload
```

✅ That’s it! You’re ready to start integrating Blaxel features using the Blaxel SDK.
