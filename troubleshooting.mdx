This page describes common issues and how to troubleshoot them.

## Preview URLs return a 502 server error

This error occurs when the server running inside the sandbox is binding to `localhost`. As a result, it is only reachable inside the sandbox; the external preview URL will not be able to access it.

To resolve this error, configure your server to bind to IP address `0.0.0.0`, so that it listens on all available network interfaces. To avoid IPv4/IPv6 compatibility issues, we recommend using the environment variable `HOST` instead of setting the address to a static value.

For example, in code:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx TypeScript
const host = process.env.HOST || '0.0.0.0';
app.listen(3000, host, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running`);
});
```

```python Python
host = os.environ.get("HOST", "0.0.0.0")
app.run(host=host, port=3000)
```
</CodeGroup>

or at the command line:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx TypeScript
npm serve -- -host 0.0.0.0
```

```python Python
python main.py -host 0.0.0.0
```
</CodeGroup>

## Deployment fails with `STARTUP TCP probe failed` or `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` error

This error occurs when the server running inside the sandbox is not binding to the correct host and port.

To resolve this error, configure your server to bind to the host and port designated by the `HOST` and `PORT` environment variables. Blaxel automatically injects these variables during deployment.

For example:

<CodeGroup>
```tsx TypeScript
const port = parseInt(env.PORT || "80");
const host = process.env.HOST || "0.0.0.0";
app.listen(port, host, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running`);
});
```

```python Python
port = os.environ.get("PORT", "80")
host = os.environ.get("HOST", "0.0.0.0")
app.run(host=host, port=port)
```
</CodeGroup>
