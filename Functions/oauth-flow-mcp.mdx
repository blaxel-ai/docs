title: 'OAuth flow for MCP integrations'

description: 'Setup a user-facing OAuth flow to create integration connections on Blaxel.'

---

Some Blaxel integrations support [OAuth](https://oauth.net/2/)-based authentication. You can automate such a flow to allow multiple users (tenants) to go through an OAuth flow and each have their integration. 

This approach is particularly useful when you need to automate the creation of dedicated MCP servers for each tenant with customized access permissions. This guide takes the example of creating such a flow for a [Gmail integration](../Integrations/Gmail).
