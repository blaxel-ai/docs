Blaxel is a **cloud computing infrastructure built for AI agents**. Our computing platform provides compute runtimes and hosting services that AI can use â€” from code sandboxes to background task infrastructure.

## Quickstart

Welcome there! ðŸ‘‹ Make sure you have created an account on Blaxel (here â†’ [https://app.blaxel.ai](https://app.blaxel.ai)), and created a first [workspace](Security/Workspace-access-control) (youâ€™ll need the workspace ID).

<Steps>

<Step title="Install Blaxel CLI">

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Install on Mac" icon="apple">

<Warning>To install Blaxel CLI, you must use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/): make sure it is installed on your machine. We are currently in the process of supporting additional installers. Check out the cURL method down below for general installation.</Warning>

Install Blaxel CLI by running the two following commands successively in a terminal:

```shell 

brew tap blaxel-ai/blaxel

```

```shell 

brew install blaxel

```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Install on Linux" icon="linux">

Install Blaxel CLI by running the following command in a terminal (non-sudo alternatives below):

```shell 
curl -fsSL \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blaxel-ai/toolkit/main/install.sh \
| BINDIR=/usr/local/bin sudo -E sh
```

If you need a non-sudo alternative (**it will ask you questions to configure**):

```shell 
curl -fsSL \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blaxel-ai/toolkit/main/install.sh \
| sh
```

If you need to install a specific version (e.g. v0.1.21):

```shell 
curl -fsSL \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blaxel-ai/toolkit/main/install.sh \
| VERSION=v0.1.21 sh
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Install with cURL" icon="code">

Install Blaxel CLI by running the following command in a terminal (non-sudo alternatives below):

```shell 
curl -fsSL \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blaxel-ai/toolkit/main/install.sh \
| BINDIR=/usr/local/bin sudo -E sh
```

If you need a non-sudo alternative (**it will ask you questions to configure**):

```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Install on Windows" icon="windows">

For the most reliable solution, we recommend adapting the aforementioned Linux commands by using Windows Subsystem for Linux.

 

First install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) if not already installed. This can be done by:

- Opening PowerShell as Administrator
- Running: `wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04`
- Restarting the computer
- From the Microsoft Store, install the Ubuntu app
- Run the command line using the aforementioned Linux installation process. Make sure to install using **sudo**.

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Login">

<Accordion title="Login to Blaxel via the CLI.">
Open a terminal and login to Blaxel using this command:

```bash
bl login
```

<Accordion title="Learn more about authentication on Blaxel">

The Blaxel SDK authenticates with your workspace using credentials from these sources, in priority order:

1. when running on Blaxel, authentication is handled automatically
2. variables in your `.env` file (`BL_WORKSPACE` and `BL_API_KEY`, or see [this page](Agents/Variables-and-secrets) for other authentication options). 
3. environment variables from your machine
4. configuration file created locally when you log in through [Blaxel CLI](cli-reference/introduction) (or deploy on Blaxel)

When developing locally, the recommended method is to just **log in to your workspace with Blaxel CLI.** This allows you to run Blaxel SDK functions that will automatically connect to your workspace without additional setup. When you deploy on Blaxel, this connection persists automatically.

When running Blaxel SDK from a remote server that is not Blaxel-hosted, we recommend using environment variables as described in the third option above.

</Step>

<Step title="Create your first resource">

Blaxel is the ultimate toolkit for AI agent builders. Our flagship product is the **Sandbox**, though you can also run the rest of your agentic workloads on our cloud.

<Accordion title="Create a sandbox" icon="box">
Sandboxes can be created programmatically using Blaxel SDK. Install the SDK:

<CodeGroup>

```shell Python (pip)

pip install blaxel

```

```shell Python (uv)

uv pip install blaxel

```

```shell TypeScript (pnpm)

pnpm install @blaxel/core

```

```shell TypeScript (npm)

npm install @blaxel/core

```

```shell TypeScript (yarn)

yarn add @blaxel/core

```

```shell TypeScript (bun)

bun add @blaxel/core

```

</CodeGroup>

Create your first sandbox:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
import { SandboxInstance } from "@blaxel/core";

async function main() {
  // Create a new sandbox
  const sandbox = await SandboxInstance.createIfNotExists({
    name: "my-sandbox",
    image: "blaxel/prod-base:latest",   // public or custom image
    memory: 4096,   // in MB
    ports: [{ target: 3000, protocol: "HTTP" }],   // ports to expose
    region: "us-pdx-1"   // if not specified, Blaxel will choose a default region
  });
  console.log("Sandbox created:", {sandbox});
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

```python Python
import asyncio
from blaxel.core import SandboxInstance

async def main():
    # Create a new sandbox
    sandbox = await SandboxInstance.create_if_not_exists({
      "name": "my-sandbox",
      "image": "blaxel/prod-base:latest",   # public or custom image
      "memory": 4096,   # in MB
      "ports": [{ "target": 3000 }],   # ports to expose
      "region": "us-pdx-1"   # if not specified, Blaxel will choose a default region
    })
    print(f"Sandbox created: {sandbox}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

</CodeGroup>

Or deploy another type of resource:

<Accordion title="Deploy an agent, batch job or MCP server">

Deploy your agentâ€™s components on a purpose-built computing infrastructure for agentics.

<Steps>
<Step title="Create the resource">

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Create an agent app" icon="robot">

<Warning>In Python, you will need to [have pip installed](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/); in TypeScript, you will need to [have npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for this.</Warning>

Letâ€™s initialize a first app. The following command initializes a new **pre-scaffolded local repository** ready for developing and deploying your agent on Blaxel.

```bash
bl new agent
```

You can now develop your agent application using any framework you want (or none), and use the [Blaxel](sdk-reference/introduction) [SDK](sdk-reference) to [leverage other Blaxel deployments](Agents/Develop-an-agent). A placeholder HTTP API server is already preconfigured in `/src/main.py` or `/src/main.ts`. 

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create a batch job" icon="list-check">
<Warning>In Python, you will need to [have pip installed](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/); in TypeScript, you will need to [have npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for this.</Warning>

Letâ€™s initialize a first batch job definition. The following command initializes a new **pre-scaffolded local repository** ready for developing and deploying your job on Blaxel.

```bash
bl new job
```

You can now develop your job and use the [Blaxel](sdk-reference/introduction) [SDK](sdk-reference) to leverage other Blaxel deployments in `/src/index.py` or `/src/index.ts`.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create an MCP server" icon="screwdriver-wrench">

<Warning>In Python, you will need to [have pip installed](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/); in TypeScript, you will need to [have npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for this.</Warning>

You can quickly **initialize a new MCP server from scratch** by using CLI command `bl new`. This initializes a new pre-scaffolded local repo where your entire code can be added.

```bash
bl new mcp
```

You can now [develop your MCP server](Functions/Create-MCP-server) using the [Blaxel](sdk-reference/introduction) [SDK](sdk-reference) in `/src/server.py` or `/src/server.ts`.

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

</Step>

<Step title="Test and deploy your workload">

Run the following command to serve your workload locally, replacing `<<DIRECTORY-NAME>>` with the name of the workload's root directory:

```bash
cd <<DIRECTORY-NAME>>;
bl serve;
```

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Agent: send a test invocation" icon="robot">

Query your agent locally by making a **POST** request to this endpoint: [`http://localhost:1338`](http://localhost:1338) with the following payload format: `{"inputs": "Hello world!"}`:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"inputs": "Hello world!"}' http://localhost:1338
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Job: execute the job locally" icon="list-check">

Execute your job locally by making a **POST** request to this endpoint: [`http://localhost:1338`](http://localhost:1338) with the following payload format: `{"tasks": [{"param1": "value1"}]}`

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"tasks": [{"name": "John"}, {"name": "Jane"}]}' http://localhost:1338
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="MCP server: test the server" icon="screwdriver-wrench">

You can test it by running the following command which launches **both** the MCP server and a web application to query it ([MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), managed by MCP) locally.

<CodeGroup>

```shell TypeScript

pnpm inspect

```

```shell Python

BL_DEBUG=true uv run mcp dev src/server.py

```

</CodeGroup>

The web application is accessible at: [http://127.0.0.1:6274](http://127.0.0.1:6274/). Alternatively, you can just simply [serve the server](Functions/Deploy-a-function) locally by running `bl serve --hotreload`.

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

To **push to Blaxel**, run the following command. Blaxel will handle the build and deployment:

```bash
bl deploy
```

Your workload is made available as a **serverless auto scalable** **global endpoint**  ðŸŒŽÂ .

</Step>

<Step title="Query your deployment">

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Agent: send an invocation request" icon="robot">

Run an inference from a terminal with the following command:

```bash
bl chat <<AGENT-NAME>>
```

This gives you a chat-like interface where you can interact with your agent. To use this when serving locally, just add option `--local` .

Alternatively, **just call the** [global endpoint](Agents/Query-agents).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Job: execute the job" icon="list-check">

Trigger an execution of your batch job from a terminal by running:

```bash
# Run a job using Blaxel CLI with --data argument
bl run job <<JOB-NAME>> --data '{"tasks": [{"name": "John"}, {"name": "Jane"}]}'
```

Alternatively, **just call the** [global endpoint](Jobs/Overview).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="MCP server: test the server" icon="screwdriver-wrench">

When you deploy an MCP server on Blaxel, a **WebSocket endpoint** is generated on Global Agentics Network to connect to the server.

The server endpoint looks like this:

```http Connect to an MCP server

wss://run.blaxel.ai/{YOUR-WORKSPACE}/functions/{YOUR-SERVER-NAME}

```

Read more about [how to connect to the server here](Functions/Invoke-functions).
