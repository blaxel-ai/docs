[Blaxel](https://app.blaxel.ai/) is a computing platform where AI builders can **deploy AI agents easily**. This tutorial demonstrates how to deploy your first workload on Blaxel.

## Quickstart

Welcome there! ðŸ‘‹ Make sure you have created an account on Blaxel (here â†’ [https://app.blaxel.ai](https://app.blaxel.ai)), and created a first [workspace](Security/Workspace-access-control). Retrieve the workspace ID.

<Tip>Upon creating a workspace, Blaxel automatically adds a starter connection to a rate-limited model API to get you started. You can bring your own credentials to model providers to connect to more [model APIs](Models/Overview).</Tip>

<Steps>

<Step title="Install Blaxel CLI">

For the most reliable solution, we recommend adapting the aforementioned Linux commands by using Windows Subsystem for Linux.

 

First install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) if not already installed. This can be done by:

- Opening PowerShell as Administrator
- Running: `wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04`
- Restarting the computer
- From the Microsoft Store, install the Ubuntu app
- Run the command line using the aforementioned Linux installation process. Make sure to install using **sudo**.

</Step>

<Step title="Create your first resource">

Blaxel is the ultimate toolkit for AI agent builders, letting you create and deploy resources on a purpose-built infrastructure for agentics.

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Create an agent application" icon="robot">

<Warning>In Python, you will need to [have *uv* installed](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/); in TypeScript, you will need to [have npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for this.</Warning>

Letâ€™s initialize a first app. The following command creates a **pre-scaffolded local repository** ready for developing and deploying your agent on Blaxel.

```bash
bl create-agent-app my-agent
```

You can now develop your agent application using any framework you want (or none), and use the [Blaxel](sdk-reference/introduction) [SDK](sdk-reference) to [leverage other Blaxel deployments](Agents/Develop-an-agent) in `/src/agent.py` or `/src/agent.ts`. A placeholder HTTP API server is already preconfigured in `/src/main.py` or `/src/main.ts`. 

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create a batch job" icon="list-check">
<Warning>In Python, you will need to [have *uv* installed](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/); in TypeScript, you will need to [have npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for this.</Warning>

Letâ€™s initialize a first batch job definition. The following command creates a **pre-scaffolded local repository** ready for developing and deploying your job on Blaxel.

```bash
bl create-job myjob
```

You can now develop your job and use the [Blaxel](sdk-reference/introduction) [SDK](sdk-reference) to leverage other Blaxel deployments in `/src/index.py` or `/src/index.ts`.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create a sandbox" icon="box">
Sandboxes can be created programmatically using Blaxel SDK. Install the SDK:

<CodeGroup>

```shell Python (pip)

pip install blaxel

```

```shell Python (uv)

uv pip install blaxel

```

```shell TypeScript (pnpm)

pnpm install @blaxel/core

```

```shell TypeScript (npm)

npm install @blaxel/core

```

```shell TypeScript (yarn)

yarn add @blaxel/core

```

```shell TypeScript (bun)

bun add @blaxel/core

```

</CodeGroup>

<Card title="Learn how to create sandboxes" icon="box" href="/Sandboxes/Overview">

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create an MCP server" icon="screwdriver-wrench">

<Warning>In Python, you will need to [have *uv* installed](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/); in TypeScript, you will need to [have npm installed](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) for this.</Warning>

You can quickly **initialize a new MCP server from scratch** by using CLI command `bl create-mcp-server`. This will create a pre-scaffolded local repo where your entire code can be added.

```bash
bl create-mcp-server my-mcp
```

You can now [develop your MCP server](Functions/Create-MCP-server) using the [Blaxel](sdk-reference/introduction) [SDK](sdk-reference) in `/src/server.py` or `/src/server.ts`.

</Step>

<Step title="Test and deploy your workload">

Run the following command to serve your workload locally, replacing `<<DIRECTORY-NAME>>` with the name of the workload's root directory:

```bash
cd <<DIRECTORY-NAME>>;
bl serve;
```

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Agent: send a test invocation" icon="robot">

Query your agent locally by making a **POST** request to this endpoint: [`http://localhost:1338`](http://localhost:1338) with the following payload format: `{"inputs": "Hello world!"}`:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"inputs": "Hello world!"}' http://localhost:1338
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Job: execute the job locally" icon="list-check">

Execute your job locally by making a **POST** request to this endpoint: [`http://localhost:1338`](http://localhost:1338) with the following payload format: `{"tasks": [{"param1": "value1"}]}`

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"tasks": [{"name": "John"}, {"name": "Jane"}]}' http://localhost:1338
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="MCP server: test the server" icon="screwdriver-wrench">

You can test it by running the following command which launches both the server and a web application ([MCP Inspector](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/inspector), managed by MCP) locally for testing the serverâ€™s capabilities during development. 

<CodeGroup>

```shell TypeScript

pnpm inspect

```

```shell Python
BL_DEBUG=true uv run mcp dev src/server.py

```

</CodeGroup>

The web application is accessible at: [http://127.0.0.1:6274](http://127.0.0.1:6274/). Alternatively, you can just simply [serve the server](Functions/Deploy-a-function) locally by running `bl serve --hotreload`.

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

To **push to Blaxel**, run the following command. Blaxel will handle the build and deployment:

```bash
bl deploy
```

Your workload is made available as a **serverless auto scalable** **global endpoint**  ðŸŒŽÂ .

</Step>

<Step title="Make a first inference">

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Agent: send an invocation request" icon="robot">

Run a first inference on your Blaxel agent with the following command:

```bash
bl chat my-agent
```

This gives you a chat-like interface where you can interact with your agent! To use this when serving locally, just add option `--local` .

Alternatively, you can send requests to your production agent by running:

```bash
bl run agent my-agent --data '{"inputs":"Hello world!"}'
```

Or by directly calling the [global endpoint](Agents/Query-agents).

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Job: execute the job" icon="list-check">

Trigger an execution of your batch job by running:

```bash
# Run a job using Blaxel CLI with --data argument
bl run job jobs-ts --data '{"tasks": [{"name": "John"}, {"name": "Jane"}]}'
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="MCP server: test the server" icon="screwdriver-wrench">

When you deploy an MCP server on Blaxel, a **WebSocket endpoint** is generated on Global Agentics Network to connect to the server.

The server endpoint looks like this:

```http Connect to an MCP server

wss://run.blaxel.ai/{YOUR-WORKSPACE}/functions/{YOUR-SERVER-NAME}

```

Read more about [how to connect to the server here](Functions/Invoke-functions).
