title: 'Global Agentics Network'

description: 'The Blaxel powerhouse to securely run AI at scale.'

---

The *Global Agentics Network* makes up the entire backbone of Blaxel. It is a globally distributed infrastructure, on which AI teams can push serverless agentic workloads across multiple clusters and locations.

The purpose of the Global Agentics Network is to serve inferences at scale, in a highly available and low-latency manner, to end-users from anywhere. The smart network securely routes requests to the best compute infrastructure based on the deployment policies you enforce, and optimizing for configurable strategies for routing, load-balancing and failover. 

On the technical level, the Global Agentics Network is made of two planes: execution clusters (the ‘*execution plane*’), and a smart global networking system (the ‘*data plane*’).

### Overview of how Global Agentics Network works

The Global Agentics Network is a **very flexible and configurable infrastructure** built for AI builders. Both the execution plane and data plane can be configured and managed through other services of the Blaxel platform.

The data plane routes all requests between end-users (consumers of your AI applications) and execution locations, as well as between workloads themselves—for example, in agentic workflows. Designed and optimized by Blaxel for tomorrow’s AI, the Network is laser-focused on minimizing latency for AI deployments.

The execution plane encompasses all physical locations where AI workloads run in response to consumers' requests. These can be managed by Blaxel or provided by you.

From a high-level perspective, the Global Agentics Network can operate in several modes, each tailored to your specific deployment strategy.

- **Mode 1: Managed Blaxel infrastructure.** Directly deploy workloads on Blaxel to make them available on the Global Agentics Network. Read [our guide on how to deploy agents on Blaxel](../Agents).
- **Mode 2: Global hybrid deployment.** Attach your private clusters to the Global Agentics Network through the Blaxel controller, and federate multi-region deployments behind our global networking system. This mode is part of our Enterprise offering, contact us at [support@blaxel.ai](mailto:support@blaxel.ai) for more information.
- **Mode 3: Offload on Blaxel**. This mode allows for **minimal footprint** on your stack and is fully transparent for your consumers. Through a Blaxel controller, you can reference Kubernetes deployments from your own private cluster and offload them to Blaxel Global Agentics Network based on conditions, for e.g. in case of sudden traffic burst. This mode is part of our Enterprise offering, contact us at [support@blaxel.ai](mailto:support@blaxel.ai) for more information.
- **Mode 4: On-prem Replication**. Through a Blaxel controller, you can reference Kubernetes deployments from your own private cluster and offload them to another of your private cluster in case of traffic burst. This mode entirely relies on open-source software. Read more on the [Github page for the open-source Blaxel controller](https://github.com/beamlit/bl-controller).
