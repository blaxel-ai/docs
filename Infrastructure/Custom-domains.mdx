description: 'Expose Blaxel resources using your own custom domains.'

---

Blaxel allows you to connect your own domain names to your Blaxel workspace to use when exposing resources.

When you register a domain, you also enable the use of wildcard subdomains for that domain. For example:

- If you register `mycompany.com`, you can use any `*.mycompany.com` subdomain to create custom URLs.
- If you register `preview.mycompany.com`, you can use any `*.preview.mycompany.com` subdomain to create custom URLs.
- And so on.

Each domain is uniquely assigned to a region. For example, if `preview.mycompany.com` is registered in region `us-pdx-1`, it is not possible to use it in region `eu-lon-1` (for example) or any other region.

In the Blaxel Console, navigate to **Network** > **Custom Domains** in the sidebar and add a new custom domain. Then, you'll need to configure DNS records with your domain provider. Finally, verify from within Blaxel: after DNS propagation completes, your custom domain will become fully usable.
