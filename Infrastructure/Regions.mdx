Blaxel is available in many regions across the globe. Some types of resources can be deployed ‘globally’ over multiple regions (for example: [agents](../Agents/Overview)), while some other types are deployed only in one specific region (for example: [sandboxes](../Sandboxes/Overview)).

This guide details the available regions for [Mark 3 infrastructure generation](Gens).

<Info>Mark 2 infrastructure is globally distributed over 15 regions — it does not feature the ability to specify a single deployment region (except though [deployment policies](../Model-Governance/Policies)).</Info>

## Available regions

The following regions are available for [Mark 3 infrastructure generation](Gens):

| **Region code** | **Location** | **Country** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `us-pdx-1` | Oregon | United States |
| `us-was-1` | North Virginia | United States |
| `eu-lon-1` | London | United Kingdom |

All regions are not necessarily available in self-service by default. Please [contact us](http://blaxel.ai/contact?message=I+would+like+to+get+access+to+region+XYZ+because+&purpose=regions&origin=docs) if you would like access to a specific region.

## Selecting a region for deployment

When deploying a resource on Blaxel, you sometimes have the option to choose the deployment region. This depends on the type of resource, as explained below.

For all resource types, the deployment region **is always subject to the** [deployment policies](../Model-Governance/Policies) applied to the resource or workspace. A resource will never be deployed in a region that is prohibited by an existing deployment policy.

### Resources which are globally distributed over multiple regions

This is the case of:

- [agents](../Agents/Overview)
- [MCP servers](../Functions/Overview)
- [batch jobs](../Jobs/Overview)

**When deploying**

For these types of resources, you don't specify a region during deployment. The resource becomes available across all regions allowed by applicable [deployment policies](../Model-Governance/Policies).

**When requesting**

For these types of resources, you receive a global query endpoint that automatically routes to the optimal region as determined by Blaxel's Global Agentics Network.

### Resources which are deployed in one specific region

- [sandboxes](../Sandboxes/Overview) (and their [preview URLs](../Sandboxes/Preview-url))

**When deploying**

For these types of resources, you can **optionally specify** a region during deployment, provided it is allowed by applicable [deployment policies](../Model-Governance/Policies). If you do not specify a region, Blaxel will deploy the resource automatically on a default region determined to be optimal.

**When requesting**

For these types of resources, you receive a regional query endpoint (which contains the name of the region in the domain).

## Public IP addresses

You can retrieve the current [list of public IP addresses](/api-reference/publicips:list/list-public-ips#list-public-ips) used by Blaxel through the Blaxel API. IP addresses are returned per region, and the results list can also be filteered by adding a `region` parameter to the API query (only for [Mark 3 infrastructure](/Infrastructure/Gens#mark-3-infrastructure)).

Here is an example API request:

```shell
curl --request GET \
  --url https://api.blaxel.ai/v0/publicIps?region=us-was-1 \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>'
```
