title: 'Query a model API'

description: 'Make inference requests on your model APIs.'

---

Model APIs on Blaxel have a unique **inference endpoint** which can be used by external consumers and agents to request an inference execution. Inference requests are then routed on the [Global Agentics Network](../Infrastructure/Global-Inference-Network) based on the [deployment policies](../Model-Governance/Policies) associated with your model API. 

## Inference endpoints

Whenever you deploy a model API on Blaxel, an **inference endpoint** is generated on Global Agentics Network.

The inference URL looks like this:

```http Query model API

POST https://run.blaxel.ai/{YOUR-WORKSPACE}/models/{YOUR-MODEL}

```

### Specific API endpoints in your model

The URL above calls your model and can be called directly. However your model may **implement additional endpoints.** These sub-endpoints will be hosted on this URL.

For example, if you are calling a text generation model that also implements the ChatCompletions API:

- calling `run.blaxel.ai/your-workspace/models/your-model` (the base endpoint) will generate text based on a prompt
- calling `run.blaxel.ai/your-workspace/models/your-model/v1/chat/completions` (the ChatCompletions API implementation) will generate response based on a list of messages

### Endpoint authentication

It is necessary to authenticate all inference requests, via a [bearer token](../Security/Access-tokens). The evaluation of authentication/authorization for inference requests is managed by the Global Agentics Network based on the [access given in your workspace](../Security/Workspace-access-control).

<Info>Making a workload publicly available is not yet available. Please contact us at [support@blaxel.ai](mailto:support@blaxel.ai) if this is something that you need today.</Info>

## Make an inference request

### Blaxel API

Make a **POST** request to the [inference endpoint](Query-a-model) for the model API you are requesting, making sure to fill in the [authentication token](Query-a-model):

```
curl 'https://run.blaxel.ai/YOUR-WORKSPACE/models/YOUR-MODEL' \
  -H 'accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' \
  -H 'x-Blaxel-authorization: Bearer YOUR-TOKEN' \
  -H 'x-Blaxel-workspace: YOUR-WORKSPACE' \
  --data-raw $'{"inputs":"Enter your input here."}'
```

Read about [the API parameters in the reference](https://docs.blaxel.ai/api-reference/inference).

### Blaxel CLI

The following command will make a default POST request to the model API.

```bash
bl run model your-model --data '{"inputs":"Enter your input here."}'
```

You can call [specific API endpoints](Query-a-model) that your model implements with the option `--path` :

```bash
bl run model your-model --path /v1/chat/completions --data '{"inputs":"Hello there!"}' 
```

Read about [the CLI parameters in the reference](https://docs.blaxel.ai/cli-reference/bl_run).

### Blaxel console

Inference requests can be made from the Blaxel console from the model APIâ€™s **Playground** page.
