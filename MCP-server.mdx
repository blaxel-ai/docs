description: 'Manage your Blaxel resources from your AI tools via MCP over HTTP.'

---

Blaxel’s MCP server lets compatible AI apps (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, etc.) manage your Blaxel resources using natural language. It is available as a **remote hosted HTTP server**.

Talk with your preferred agent to:

- Create new services
- Follow what is happening on your infrastructure
- Manage your users

## How it works

The MCP server is hosted at:

```
https://api.blaxel.ai/v0/mcp
```

Clients connect over HTTP(S) and stream MCP messages. Authentication is provided via headers.

## Authentication headers

Provide your [API key](Security/Access-tokens) in the `Authorization` header. If your user has access to multiple workspaces, include the workspace header as well.

- Required: `Authorization: Bearer <APIKEY>`
- Optional (multi-workspace): `X-Blaxel-Workspace: <WORKSPACE_NAME_OR_ID>`

## Setup

### Cursor

Add the server to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "blaxel": {
      "url": "https://api.blaxel.ai/v0/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <APIKEY>",
        "X-Blaxel-Workspace": "<OPTIONAL_WORKSPACE>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code

[Add the remote HTTP server to your Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/mcp#option-3%3A-add-a-remote-http-server) by running the following command:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http blaxel https://api.blaxel.ai/v0/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <APIKEY>" \
  --header "X-Blaxel-Workspace: <OPTIONAL_WORKSPACE>"
```

### Windsurf

Add to `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "blaxel": {
      "url": "https://api.blaxel.ai/v0/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer <APIKEY>",
        "X-Blaxel-Workspace": "<OPTIONAL_WORKSPACE>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Selecting a workspace

If your account has multiple workspaces, set the active workspace by including the `X-Blaxel-Workspace` header. If omitted, your AI app may prompt you to specify one when a tool is invoked.

## Example prompts

Ask your AI app to perform actions using Blaxel MCP tools, for example:

- List my agents
- Create a new MCP server named search with blaxel-search integration
- Invite test@mydomain.com to my workspace

## Supported actions

The Blaxel MCP server exposes tools for common platform operations.

You can list, create and remove services (Agent, MCP, Jobs, Models, Sandboxes…), manage users and service account. And much more to come

See the open-source definitions for the latest list and schemas.

## Running locally

Prefer using the hosted server at `https://api.blaxel.ai/v0/mcp`. If you must run locally or customize behavior, clone the repository and follow its instructions.

## Limitations

- The server requires a valid API key.
- When using multiple workspaces, `X-Blaxel-Workspace` must be provided to disambiguate.
