description: 'Run inferences on your Blaxel deployments.'

---

Whenever you deploy a workload on Blaxel, an **inference endpoint** is generated on Global Agentics Network, the [infrastructure powerhouse](../Infrastructure/Global-Inference-Network) that hosts it.

The inference API URL depends on the type of workload ([agent](../Agents/Overview), [model API](../Models/Overview), [MCP server](../Functions/Overview)) you are trying to request:

<CodeGroup>

```http Query agent

POST https://run.blaxel.ai/{YOUR-WORKSPACE}/agents/{YOUR-AGENT}

```

```http Query model API

POST https://run.blaxel.ai/{YOUR-WORKSPACE}/models/{YOUR-MODEL}

```

```http Connect to an MCP server

wss://run.blaxel.ai/{YOUR-WORKSPACE}/functions/{YOUR-SERVER-NAME}

```

```http Execute a job

POST https://run.blaxel.ai/{YOUR-WORKSPACE}/jobs/{YOUR-JOB-NAME}/executions

```

</CodeGroup>

Showing the full request, with the input payload:

<CodeGroup>

```http Query agent

curl -X POST "https://run.blaxel.ai/{your-workspace}/agents/{your-agent}" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H "X-Blaxel-Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
-d '{"inputs":"Hello, world!"}'

```

```http Query model API (example on a chat completion model)

curl -X POST "https://run.blaxel.ai/{your-workspace}/models/{your-model}/chat/completions" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H "X-Blaxel-Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
-d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]}'

```

```http Execute a job

curl -X POST "https://run.blaxel.ai/{your-workspace}/jobs/{your-job-name}/executions" \
-H "X-Blaxel-Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
'{"tasks":[{"my_arg":"my_value"}]}’

```

</CodeGroup>

### Connect to MCP servers

**MCP servers** ([Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol)) provide a toolkit of multiple capabilities for agents. These servers can be interacted with using Blaxel’s WebSocket transport implementation on the server’s global endpoint.

### Manage sessions

To simulate multi-turn conversations, you can pass on request headers. You'll need your client to generate this ID and pass it using any header which you can retrieve via the code (e.g. `Thread-Id`). Without a thread ID, the agent won't maintain nor use any conversation memory when processing the request.

This is only available for agent requests.

```http Query agent with thread ID

curl -X POST "https://run.blaxel.ai/{your-workspace}/agents/{your-agent}" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H "X-Blaxel-Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
-H "X-Blaxel-Thread-Id: <THREAD_ID>" \
-d '{"inputs":"Hello, world!"}'
