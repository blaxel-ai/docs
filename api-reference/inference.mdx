title: 'Inference API'

description: 'Run inferences on your Blaxel deployments.'

---

Whenever you deploy a workload on Blaxel, an **inference endpoint** is generated on Global Agentics Network, the [infrastructure powerhouse](../Infrastructure/Global-Inference-Network) that hosts it.

The inference API URL depends on the type of workload ([agent](../Agents/Overview), [model API](../Models/Overview), [MCP server](../Functions/Overview)) you are trying to request:

<CodeGroup>

```http Query agent

POST https://run.blaxel.ai/{YOUR-WORKSPACE}/agents/{YOUR-AGENT}

```

```http Query model API

POST https://run.blaxel.ai/{YOUR-WORKSPACE}/models/{YOUR-MODEL}

```

```http Connect to an MCP server

https://run.blaxel.ai/{YOUR-WORKSPACE}/functions/{YOUR-SERVER-NAME}/mcp

```

```http Execute a job

POST https://run.blaxel.ai/{YOUR-WORKSPACE}/jobs/{YOUR-JOB-NAME}/executions

```

</CodeGroup>

Showing the full request, with the input payload:

<Tab title="Query agent">

```http
curl -X POST "https://run.blaxel.ai/{your-workspace}/agents/{your-agent}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-Blaxel-Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
-d '{"inputs":"Hello, world!"}'
```

If you have the Blaxel CLI `bl` installed, you can use it to directly interpolate your API key into the HTTP request, as shown below:

```http
curl -X POST "https://run.blaxel.ai/{your-workspace}/agents/{your-agent}" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-Blaxel-Authorization: Bearer $(bl token)" \
-d '{"inputs":"Hello, world!"}'
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Query model API (example on a chat completion model)">

```http
curl -X POST "https://run.blaxel.ai/{your-workspace}/models/{your-model}/chat/completions" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-Blaxel-Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
-d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]}'
```

If you have the Blaxel CLI `bl` installed, you can use it to directly interpolate your API key into the HTTP request, as shown below:

```http
curl -X POST "https://run.blaxel.ai/{your-workspace}/models/{your-model}/chat/completions" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-H "X-Blaxel-Authorization: Bearer $(bl token)" \
-d '{"messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Hello!"}]}'
```

</Tab>
<Tab title="Execute a job">

```http
curl -X POST "https://run.blaxel.ai/{your-workspace}/jobs/{your-job-name}/executions" \
-H "X-Blaxel-Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
-d '{"tasks":[{"my_arg":"my_value"}]}’
```

If you have the Blaxel CLI `bl` installed, you can use it to directly interpolate your API key into the HTTP request, as shown below:

```http
curl -X POST "https://run.blaxel.ai/{your-workspace}/jobs/{your-job-name}/executions" \

### Connect to MCP servers

**MCP servers** ([Model Context Protocol](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol)) provide a toolkit of multiple capabilities for agents. These servers can be interacted with using Blaxel’s WebSocket transport implementation on the server’s global endpoint. These servers can be interacted with using Blaxel's streamable HTTP transport implementation on the server’s global endpoint.

<Warning>
Blaxel has replaced its WebSockets implementation for MCP transport with streamable HTTP (as of November 2025). Blaxel will continue to temporarily support WebSockets for a transition period, but users should update their deployments to the streamable HTTP transport as soon as possible to avoid errors.

### Manage sessions

To simulate multi-turn conversations, you can pass on request headers. You'll need your client to generate this ID and pass it using any header which you can retrieve via the code (e.g. `Thread-Id`). Without a thread ID, the agent won't maintain nor use any conversation memory when processing the request.

This is only available for agent requests.

```http Query agent with thread ID

curl -X POST "https://run.blaxel.ai/{your-workspace}/agents/{your-agent}" \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H "X-Blaxel-Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>" \
-H "X-Blaxel-Thread-Id: <THREAD_ID>" \
-d '{"inputs":"Hello, world!"}'

```
