## Overview

Blaxel CLI includes error tracking to help improve the CLI's reliability and user experience. This tracking collects minimal, non-identifiable error information when the CLI encounters issues, helping the Blaxel team identify and fix problems quickly.

## What is Tracked

When the CLI encounters an error or crash, the following information may be collected:

- **Error details**: Stack traces, error messages, and error codes
- **CLI version**: The version of Blaxel CLI being used
- **Operating system**: Basic OS information (e.g., Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Command context**: The command that was running when the error occurred (without arguments or parameters)

### What is NOT Tracked

The following information is **never** collected:

- Command arguments or parameters
- File contents or workspace data
- Environment variables
- API keys, tokens, or credentials
- Network locations or IP addresses
- Custom configuration values

## Managing Tracking

Tracking is enabled by default to help improve the CLI experience for all users. You can control tracking behavior through multiple methods, listed here in order of precedence.

### Method 1: Environment Variable (Highest Priority)

The `BL_TRACKING` environment variable takes precedence over all other settings:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Disable tracking for a single command
BL_TRACKING=false bl deploy
```

```bash Disable tracking for the current session
export BL_TRACKING=false
```

```bash Enable tracking explicitly
export BL_TRACKING=true
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
When running CLI commands, the `BL_TRACKING` environment variable provides a quick way to control tracking without modifying configuration files.
</Note>

### Method 2: Configuration File

You can permanently configure tracking preferences in your Blaxel configuration file at `~/.blaxel/config.yaml`:

```yaml
tracking: false  # Disable tracking
# or
tracking: true   # Enable tracking
```

To edit your configuration:

```bash
# Create config file if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p ~/.blaxel
touch ~/.blaxel/config.yaml

# Edit the file with your preferred editor
nano ~/.blaxel/config.yaml
```

### Priority Order

Settings are evaluated in the following order:

1. **`BL_TRACKING` environment variable** (highest priority)
2. **`tracking` field in `~/.blaxel/config.yaml`**
3. **Default setting: `true`** (enabled)

<Warning>
If you set `BL_TRACKING=true` in your environment but have `tracking: false` in your config file, tracking will be **enabled** because the environment variable takes precedence.
</Warning>

## SDK Applications

If you're using Blaxel SDK directly in TypeScript or Python applications (without the CLI), the same `BL_TRACKING` environment variable controls SDK tracking. For detailed information about SDK tracking configuration, see the [SDK Tracking Documentation](/sdk-reference/tracking).

## Privacy Commitment

- **Minimal**: Only error-related technical information is tracked
- **Secure**: All data transmission uses encrypted channels
- **Transparent**: This documentation describes everything that is collected
- **Respectful**: Your opt-out choice is always honored
