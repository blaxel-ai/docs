For the most reliable solution, we recommend adapting the aforementioned Linux commands by using Windows Subsystem for Linux.

 

First install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) if not already installed. This can be done by:

- Opening PowerShell as Administrator
- Running: `wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04`
- Restarting the computer
- From the Microsoft Store, install the Ubuntu app
- Run the command line using the aforementioned Linux installation process. Make sure to install using **sudo**.

```

```bash bash
echo 'eval "$(bl completion bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

```fish fish
echo 'bl completion fish' > ~/.config/fish/completions/bl.fish
```

```powershell powershell
if (!(Test-Path -Path $PROFILE)) {
New-Item -ItemType File -Path $PROFILE -Force

Add-Content -Path $PROFILE -Value '(& bl completion powershell) | Out-String | Invoke-Expression'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Get started

To get started with Blaxel CLI, your must first create a [workspace](../Security/Workspace-access-control) on the Blaxel console. Then, login to Blaxel using this command:

```bash
bl login
```

In case you have multiple workspaces, the one you logged in to will be used automatically in every command you used with our CLI.

You can login to as much workspace as you want

To set your context to a  different workspace you already logged in to, use the following command:

```bash
bl workspaces your-workspace

### You can retrieve the list of all your workspaces by running:
bl workspaces
```

You can now run any command to interact with Blaxel resources in your workspace. For example, to list agents:

```bash
bl get agents
```

## **Options**

```
-h, --help               Get the help for Blaxel
-w, --workspace string   Specify the Blaxel workspace to work on.
-o, --output string      Output format. One of: pretty, yaml, json, table
-v, --verbose            Enable verbose output
```
