First install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) if not already installed. This can be done by:

- Opening PowerShell as Administrator
- Running: `wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04`
- Restarting the computer
- From the Microsoft Store, install the Ubuntu app
- Run the command line using the aforementioned Linux installation process. Make sure to install using **sudo**.

## Get started

To get started with Blaxel CLI, your must first create a [workspace](../Security/Workspace-access-control) on the Blaxel console. Then, login to Blaxel using this command. Find your **workspace ID in the top left sidebar corner** of Blaxel Console:

```bash
bl login <<WORKSPACE-ID>>
```

You will be prompted to finish login using either an [API key](../Security/Access-tokens), or through your browser.

Set a workspace to use as a context for the session by using the following command:

```bash
bl workspaces your-workspace

### You can retrieve the list of all your workspaces by running:
bl workspaces
```

You can now run any command to interact with Blaxel resources in your workspace. For example, to list agents:

```bash
bl get agents
```

## **Options**

```
-h, --help               Get the help for Blaxel
-w, --workspace string   Specify the Blaxel workspace to work on.
-o, --output string      Output format. One of: pretty, yaml, json, table
