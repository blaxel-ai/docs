Blaxel CLI is a command line tool to interact with the Blaxel APIs.

## Install

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Install on Mac" icon="apple">

```

```shell

brew install blaxel

```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Install on Linux" icon="linux">

Install Blaxel CLI by running the following command in a terminal (non-sudo alternatives below):

```shell
curl -fsSL \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blaxel-ai/toolkit/main/install.sh \
| BINDIR=/usr/local/bin sudo -E sh
```

If you need a non-sudo alternative (**it will ask you questions to configure**):

```shell
curl -fsSL \
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/blaxel-ai/toolkit/main/install.sh \

For the most reliable solution, we recommend adapting the aforementioned Linux commands by using Windows Subsystem for Linux.

First install WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) if not already installed. This can be done by:

- Opening PowerShell as Administrator
- Running: `wsl --install -d Ubuntu-20.04`
- Restarting the computer
- From the Microsoft Store, install the Ubuntu app
- Run the command line using the aforementioned Linux installation process. Make sure to install using **sudo**.

## Shell autocompletion

To enable shell autocompletion for Blaxel CLI commands, run one of the following:

<CodeGroup>

```zsh zsh
echo 'eval "$(bl completion zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```

```bash bash
echo 'eval "$(bl completion bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
```

```fish fish
echo 'bl completion fish' > ~/.config/fish/completions/bl.fish
```

```powershell powershell
if (!(Test-Path -Path $PROFILE)) {
New-Item -ItemType File -Path $PROFILE -Force
}
Add-Content -Path $PROFILE -Value '(& bl completion powershell) | Out-String | Invoke-Expression'
```

</CodeGroup>

## Data collection

Blaxel CLI collects and sends error information to Blaxel to help improve the CLI's reliability and user experience.

When the CLI encounters an error or crash, the following information may be collected:

- **Error details**: Stack traces, error messages, and error codes
- **CLI version**: The version of Blaxel CLI being used
- **Operating system**: Basic OS information (e.g., Linux, macOS, Windows)
- **Command context**: The command that was running when the error occurred (without arguments or parameters)

The following information is **never** collected:

- Command arguments or parameters
- File contents or workspace data
- Environment variables
- API keys, tokens, or credentials
- Network locations or IP addresses
- Custom configuration values

Error tracking and transmission is enabled by default. You can control this behavior through multiple methods, listed here in order of precedence.

### DO_NOT_TRACK environment variable

When running CLI commands, the `DO_NOT_TRACK` environment variable provides a quick way to control tracking without modifying configuration files. This environment variable takes precedence over all other settings:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Disable tracking for a single command
DO_NOT_TRACK=false bl deploy
```

```bash Disable tracking for the current session
export DO_NOT_TRACK=false
```

```bash Enable tracking explicitly
export DO_NOT_TRACK=true
```
</CodeGroup>

### Configuration file

You can permanently configure preferences in your Blaxel configuration file at `~/.blaxel/config.yaml` (you can create this file if it doesn't already exist):

```yaml
tracking: false  # Disable tracking
# or
tracking: true   # Enable tracking
```

<Warning>
If you set `DO_NOT_TRACK=true` in your environment but have `tracking: true` in your config file, tracking will be disabled because the environment variable takes precedence.
</Warning>

If you're using the Blaxel SDK directly in TypeScript or Python applications (without the CLI), the same `DO_NOT_TRACK` environment variable controls SDK tracking. For detailed information, see the [SDK documentation](/sdk-reference/data-collection).

## Get started

To get started with Blaxel CLI, your must first create a [workspace](../Security/Workspace-access-control) on the Blaxel console. Then, login to Blaxel using this command:

```bash
bl login
```

If you have multiple workspaces, the one you last logged into will be used automatically in every subsequent command you run. You can login to as many workspaces as you want.

To set your context to a  different workspace you already logged in to, use the following command:

```bash
bl workspaces your-workspace

### You can retrieve the list of all your workspaces by running:
bl workspaces
```

You can now run any command to interact with Blaxel resources in your workspace. For example, to list sandboxes:

```bash
bl get sandboxes
```

## **Options**

```
-h, --help               Get the help for Blaxel
-w, --workspace string   Specify the Blaxel workspace to work on.
-o, --output string      Output format. One of: pretty, yaml, json, table
-v, --verbose            Enable verbose output
```
