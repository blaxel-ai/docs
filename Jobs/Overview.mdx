## Concepts

- **Job**: A code definition that specifies a batch processing task. Jobs can run multiple times within a single execution and accept optional input parameters.
- **Execution**: A specific instance of running a batch job at a given timestamp. Each execution consists of multiple tasks running in parallel.
- **Task**: A single instance of a job definition running as part of an execution.
