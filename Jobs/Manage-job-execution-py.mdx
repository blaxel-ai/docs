title: 'Manage job execution in Python'

description: 'Use the Blaxel SDK to manage batch job execution in Python.'

---

You can programmatically execute and manage batch jobs using the Blaxel API and Python SDK.

Both synchronous and asynchronous usage is supported: use `method_name` for synchronous operations and `amethod_name()` for asynchronous operations.

<Note>
The code examples in this section assume that your batch job has already been successfully deployed on Blaxel.
</Note>

### Dispatch job execution

Dispatch a job and wait for execution to start:

```python
from blaxel.core.jobs import bl_job
from blaxel.core.client.models.create_job_execution_request import CreateJobExecutionRequest

job = bl_job("my-job")
request = CreateJobExecutionRequest(tasks=[{"duration": 60}])
execution_id = job.create_execution(request)
result = job.wait_for_execution(execution_id, max_wait=180)
```

<Note>
Time units in the Python SDK are specified in seconds.
</Note>

### Dispatch job execution with tasks

Dispatch a new job with tasks:

```python
# synchronous
request = CreateJobExecutionRequest(tasks=[{"duration": 30}, {"duration": 60}])
execution_id = job.create_execution(request)

# asynchronous
execution_id = await job.acreate_execution(request)
```

### Get execution details

Get full execution details:

```python
# synchronous
execution = job.get_execution(execution_id)

# asynchronous
execution = await job.aget_execution(execution_id)
```

### Get status

The possible job states are:

```
pending → running → completed
                 ↘ failed
```

Get only the job status (faster than retrieving full execution details):

```python
# synchronous
status = job.get_execution_status(execution_id)

# asynchronous
status = await job.aget_execution_status(execution_id)
```

### List executions

List all executions for a job:

```python
# synchronous
executions = job.list_executions(limit=50)

# asynchronous
executions = await job.alist_executions(limit=50)
```

### Wait for completion

Poll until execution completes:

```python
# synchronous
result = job.wait_for_execution(
    execution_id,
    max_wait=300,  # 5 minutes (seconds)
    interval=2     # Poll every 2 seconds (seconds)
)

# asynchronous
result = await job.await_for_execution(execution_id, max_wait=300, interval=2)
```

<Tip>
When polling:
- adjust the `interval` based on the expected task duration
- set the `max_wait` timeout longer than the expected total task duration
</Tip>

### Complete example

Here is a complete example using synchronous operations:

```python
from blaxel.core.jobs import bl_job
from blaxel.core.client.models.create_job_execution_request import CreateJobExecutionRequest

job = bl_job("my-job")

# create execution
request = CreateJobExecutionRequest(tasks=[{"name": "John"}, {"name": "Jane"}])
execution_id = job.create_execution(request)

# monitor
status = job.get_execution_status(execution_id)
print(f"Status: {status}")

# wait
try:
    result = job.wait_for_execution(execution_id, max_wait=180, interval=5)
    print(f"Completed: {result.status}")
except Exception as error:
    print(f"Timeout: {error}")
```

Here is a complete example using asynchronous operations:

```python
import asyncio
from blaxel.core.jobs import bl_job
from blaxel.core.client.models.create_job_execution_request import CreateJobExecutionRequest

async def main():
    job = bl_job("my-job")

    request = CreateJobExecutionRequest(tasks=[{"name": "John"}, {"name": "Jane"}])
    execution_id = await job.acreate_execution(request)

    status = await job.aget_execution_status(execution_id)
    print(f"Status: {status}")

    result = await job.await_for_execution(execution_id, max_wait=180, interval=5)
    print(f"Completed: {result.status}")

asyncio.run(main())
```
