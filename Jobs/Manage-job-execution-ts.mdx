description: 'Use the Blaxel SDK to manage batch job execution in TypeScript.'

---

You can programmatically execute and manage batch jobs using the Blaxel API and TypeScript SDK.

<Note>
The code examples in this section assume that your batch job has already been successfully deployed on Blaxel.
</Note>

### Dispatch job execution

Dispatch a job and wait for execution to start:

```typescript
import { blJob } from "@blaxel/core";

const job = blJob("my-job");
const executionId = await job.createExecution({
  tasks: [{ duration: 60 }]
});
const result = await job.waitForExecution(executionId);
```

<Note>
Time units in the TypeScript SDK are specified in milliseconds.
</Note>

### Dispatch job execution with tasks

Dispatch a new job with tasks:

```typescript
const executionId = await job.createExecution({
  tasks: [
    { duration: 30 },
    { duration: 60 },
  ]
});
```

### Get execution details

Get full execution details:

```typescript
const execution = await job.getExecution(executionId);
console.log(execution.status, execution.metadata);
```

### Get status

The possible job states are:

```
pending → running → completed
                 ↘ failed
```

Get only the job status (faster than retrieving full execution details):

```typescript
const status = await job.getExecutionStatus(executionId);
// Returns: "pending" | "running" | "completed" | "failed"
```

### List executions

List all executions for a job:

```typescript
const executions = await job.listExecutions();
console.log(`Found ${executions.length} executions`);
```

### Wait for completion

Poll until execution completes:

```typescript
const result = await job.waitForExecution(executionId, {
  maxWait: 300000,  // 5 minutes (milliseconds)
  interval: 2000,   // Poll every 2 seconds (milliseconds)
});
```

<Tip>
When polling:
- adjust the `interval` based on the expected task duration
- set the `maxWait` timeout longer than the expected total task duration
</Tip>

### Complete example

Here is a complete example:

```typescript
import { blJob } from "@blaxel/core";

const job = blJob("data-processing");

// create execution
const executionId = await job.createExecution({
  tasks: [{"name": "John"}, {"name": "Jane"}]
});

// monitor
let status = await job.getExecutionStatus(executionId);
console.log(`Status: ${status}`);

// wait
try {
  const result = await job.waitForExecution(executionId, {
    maxWait: 180000,
    interval: 5000,
  });
  console.log(`Completed: ${result.status}`);
} catch (error) {
  console.log(`Timeout: ${error.message}`);
}
```
