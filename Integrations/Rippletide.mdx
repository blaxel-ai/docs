This example shows how to integrate hypergraph provider [Rippletide](https://www.rippletide.com/) with Blaxel to create a customer support agent that provides instant, accurate responses to customer inquiries across multiple communication channels.

## Requirements

To use this example, you'll need a Rippletide API key. Contact [patrick@rippletide.com](mailto:patrick@rippletide.com) or [yann@rippletide.com](mailto:yann@rippletide.com) to get an API key.

## Clone the example repository

Clone the [example repository](https://github.com/blaxel-templates/template-rippletide-customer-support) and follow the instructions provided to install dependencies.

## Customize the knowledge base

Update the files in the `knowledge-base` directory with business- or scenario-specific information and workflows. The agent will use this information to respond to customer enquiries and to transition between workflow states.

## Create an agent

Configure the following environment variable in order to obtain an agent ID:

```
RIPPLETIDE_API_KEY=   # your Rippletide API key
```

Create an agent:

```bash
uv run src/setup.py
```

Once your agent is created, the setup process will return an agent ID.

Create a `.env` file in the project root with both variables, or set them in your deployment environment.

```
RIPPLETIDE_API_KEY=   # your Rippletide API key
RIPPLETIDE_AGENT_ID=  # your Rippletide agent ID
```

## Deploy the agent

[Deploy the agent](../Agents/Deploy-an-agent) on Blaxel. Once the agent is deployed, retrieve its [inference endpoint](../Agents/Query-agents).

You will need an API key to query the agent externally. Follow [this guide to create a service account in your workspace and generate an API key](../Security/Service-accounts).
