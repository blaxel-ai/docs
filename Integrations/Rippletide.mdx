---

This integration combines [Rippletide](https://www.rippletide.com/) with Blaxel to ensure agent safety and trust. Rippletide's hypergraph database ensures agents respect guardrails and prevent hallucinations, while Blaxel provides secure sandboxes for agent code execution, enabling reliable and trusted agent deployments.

## Requirements

To use this example, you'll need a Rippletide API key, which you can obtain at [https://eval.rippletide.com](https://eval.rippletide.com).

## Clone the example repository

Clone the [example repository](FIXME) and follow the instructions provided to install dependencies and configure the agent. You must also create a knowledge base of business- or scenario-specific information and workflows, which the agent will use to respond to customer enquiries and to transition between workflow states.

## Deploy the agent

[Deploy the agent](../Agents/Deploy-an-agent) on Blaxel. Once the agent is deployed, retrieve its [inference endpoint](../Agents/Query-agents).

You will need an API key to query the agent externally. Follow [this guide to create a service account in your workspace and generate an API key](../Security/Service-accounts).
