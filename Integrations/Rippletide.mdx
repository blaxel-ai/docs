This integration combines [Rippletide](https://www.rippletide.com/) with Blaxel to ensure agent safety and trust. Rippletide's hypergraph database ensures agents respect guardrails and prevent hallucinations, while Blaxel provides secure sandboxes for agent code execution, enabling reliable and trusted agent deployments.

## Requirements

To use this example, you'll need a Rippletide API key, which you can obtain at [https://eval.rippletide.com](https://eval.rippletide.com).

## Clone the example repository

Clone the [example repository](https://github.com/blaxel-templates/template-rippletide-customer-support) and follow the instructions provided to install dependencies.

## Customize the knowledge base

Update the files in the `knowledge-base` directory with business- or scenario-specific information and workflows. The agent will use this information to respond to customer enquiries and to transition between workflow states.

## Create an agent

Configure the following environment variable in order to obtain an agent ID:

```
RIPPLETIDE_API_KEY=   # your Rippletide API key
```

Create an agent:

```bash
uv run src/setup.py
```

Once your agent is created, the setup process will return an agent ID.

Create a `.env` file in the project root with both variables, or set them in your deployment environment.

```
RIPPLETIDE_API_KEY=   # your Rippletide API key
RIPPLETIDE_AGENT_ID=  # your Rippletide agent ID
```

## Deploy the agent

[Deploy the agent](../Agents/Deploy-an-agent) on Blaxel. Once the agent is deployed, retrieve its [inference endpoint](../Agents/Query-agents).

You will need an API key to query the agent externally. Follow [this guide to create a service account in your workspace and generate an API key](../Security/Service-accounts).
