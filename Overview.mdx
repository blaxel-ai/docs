Blaxel is a **cloud infrastructure built for AI agents**. Our computing platform gives AI Builders the services, infra, and developer experience optimized to build and deploy agentic AI — with a twist: your agents can also take the wheel.

An *AI agent* is any application that leverages generative AI models to take autonomous actions in the real world—whether by interacting with humans or using APIs to read and write data. 

<Accordion title="Some examples of agents include…">

- **Conversational agents** that are able to take action in the world while keeping a human in the loop for activation or validation: for example an AI agent for an e-commerce website, assisting consumers with purchases and refunds with a natural language interface.
- **Retrieval Augmented Generation** **(RAG) agents**: for example, a chatbot assistant for a SaaS that can better answer consumers’ queries by autonomously accessing the software documentation and reference
- **AI-powered data pipelines**: for example a data transformation pipeline that retrieves unstructured data from sources, uses an LLM to turn this raw data into structured data, and insert it back into a database
- **Automated agents** that automate machine-to-machine workflows with AI: for example a system that retrieves traffic video feeds in real-time, detects the presence of accidents, and if so contacts emergency services automatically by generating and sending a detailed report.

Blaxel provides developer tools for running such production-grade multi-agents that can use tools, LLMs and code sandboxes ; and offers infrastructure to run these agents on a global network that makes them run fast and reliably.

This portal provides comprehensive documentation and API, SDK and CLI reference to help you operate Blaxel Platform.

## Essential concepts

Blaxel is a cloud designed for agentic AI. It **doesn't force you into any kind of workflow** or shaped box. While we encourage you to exploit architecture designs that we consider are more reliable, our toolkit gives you all the pieces you need to build agentic systems exactly the way you want.

Blaxel consists of modular services that are engineered to work seamlessly together — but you can also just use any one of them independently. Think of it as a purpose-built set of building blocks that you can use to power and ship agents.

### The building blocks

At the heart of Blaxel is our flagship **Agents Hosting** service. Agents Hosting lets you deploy your AI agents as serverless auto scalable endpoints. 

- Completely framework agnostic. Just bring your code, Blaxel builds it and runs it for you.
- Asynchronous endpoints with automatic queuing and retries
- Full observability — out-of-the-box

The rest of Blaxel’s cloud services include:

- **MCP Servers Hosting** - Deploy custom tool servers on a fast-starting infrastructure to extend your agents' capabilities.
- **Model Gateway** - Intelligent routing layer to LLM providers with built-in telemetry, token cost control, and fallbacks capabilities
- **Sandboxes** - Near instant-starting micro VMs that provide agents with their own compute runtime to execute code or run commands.
- **Batch Jobs** - Scalable compute engine designed for agents to schedule and execute many AI processing tasks in parallel in the background

### The Blaxel method

As the ultimate AI builder's playground, Blaxel doesn’t require you to learn and adopt a framework or architecture. However, we do recommend best-practices from our experience working with top AI teams and aim to provide guardrails and framing when you build your agents.

- Break down and distribute your agents whenever possible. A single monolithic agent handling all tool calls, LLM calls, and task workflows can be deployed to Blaxel—but it will be harder to maintain, monitor, and will use resources inefficiently. Blaxel SDK allows builders to split services and connect them from your code.
- You can call LLM providers directly from your code, but we recommend you go through Blaxel’s Model Gateway for telemetry.
- Similarly, while direct tool calls are possible, deploying separate MCP servers improves reusability, optimizes resources, and simplifies monitoring. Blaxel also optimizes placement globally when your serverless tool server needs to make multiple backend calls.
- Break large agents into smaller, specialized sub-agents when possible—they're easier to debug and observe.
- Agentic systems naturally connect with many services both inside and outside your network, mixing North-South and East-West traffic in cloud terms. Strong observability is essential for reliability.
- Reliability is the biggest challenge in agentic AI. Focus on fine-tuning your prompts, tool calls, data access, and orchestration logic—Blaxel will handle the execution.

## The Blaxel powerhouse

When you deploy workloads to Blaxel, they run on a technical backbone called the **Global Agentics Network**. Its natively serverless architecture automatically scales computing resources without any server management on your part. 

Global Agentics Network serves as the powerhouse for the entire Blaxel platform, from Agents Hosting to Sandboxes. It is natively **distributed** in order to optimize for low-latency or other strategies. It allows for multi-region deployment, enabling AI workloads (such as an AI agent processing inference requests) to run across multiple geographic areas or cloud providers. This is accomplished by decoupling this execution layer from a data layer made of a smart distributed network that federates all those execution locations.

Finally, the platform implements advanced security measures, including fine-grained authentication and authorization through Blaxel IAM, ensuring that your AI infrastructure remains protected. It can be interacted with through various methods, including APIs, CLI, web console, and MCP servers.
