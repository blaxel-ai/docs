Blaxel provides an agent template that packages the [OpenClaw agent](https://openclaw.ai) for near-instant deployment on Blaxel's infrastructure, giving you a fully managed OpenClaw instance accessible via a public URL.

A key benefit of using this template is that it comes with built-in skills to work with Blaxel sandboxes, including starting and stopping them, writing and running code in them, and creating preview URLs. This makes it easy to explore OpenClaw's capabilities safely, as all operations (such as arbitrary code generation and execution) can be performed in a secure, isolated Blaxel sandbox with zero additional configuration.

This tutorial explains how to deploy and run the OpenClaw agent on Blaxel.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- a [Blaxel account](https://blaxel.ai)
- an API key from any of the [supported model providers](https://docs.openclaw.ai/concepts/model-providers)

## Configure the OpenClaw agent template

1. [Download and install the Blaxel CLI](https://docs.blaxel.ai/cli-reference/introduction#install) and log in to your Blaxel account:

    ```shell
    bl login
    ```

1. Clone the agent template:

    ```shell
    bl new agent -t template-openclaw my-openclaw
    cd my-openclaw
    ```

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

    ```shell
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

1. Update the `.env` file with the following configuration values:

    - `OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN`: Set the token to authenticate with the OpenClaw Gateway. Use a random hard-to-guess value.
    - `OPENCLAW_MODEL`: Set the model to use, such as `anthropic/claude-opus-4-6`.
    - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Set the model API key.

    You can add other variables that your OpenClaw agent may need. These variables will be automatically stored in Blaxel's secret manager on deployment.

## Deploy the agent

<Important>
  The OpenClaw template exposes the OpenClaw agent at a publicly accessible endpoint with no authentication or access controls enabled by default. If you require restricted access, you must deploy the agent behind an authentication/authorization layer (for example, API gateway, reverse proxy, or custom authentication middleware) before exposing the URL.
</Important>

1. Deploy the agent:

    ```shell
    bl deploy
    ```

1. Browse to the "Curl" URL shown at the end of the deployment output.

    This displays the OpenClaw Control UI.

1. Navigate to the **Overview** page of the OpenClaw Control UI. Enter the dashboard token configured earlier in the **Gateway Token** field. Click **Connect**.

The Control UI should now be fully functional and ready to accept requests, verified by the health check in the top right corner.

## Test OpenClaw

Navigate to the **Chat** page, enter a prompt, and wait for a reply to confirm that the OpenClaw agent is working. You will be asked a few setup questions to provision the agent.

You can use the built-in Blaxel skills to give the agent tasks to perform in a sandboxed environment, as with the example below:

![chat](/img/tutorials/openclaw/chat2.png)

OpenClaw will create a new sandbox, generate the required code, and return a URL which you can use to preview the result. The agent's actions will take place within the boundaries of the Blaxel sandbox, ensuring complete isolation of the agent-generated code and commands.

## Configure OpenClaw channels

OpenClaw supports multiple channels. To enable them, set the relevant environment variable and redeploy. For example, for Telegram:

- Add the token to the `.env` file: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=123456:ABC-DEF...`
- Redeploy: `bl deploy`

For other channels, configure them through the Control UI after connecting, or add them to the `openclaw.json` config in `entrypoint.sh`.
