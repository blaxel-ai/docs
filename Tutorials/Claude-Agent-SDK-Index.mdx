Anthropic's [Claude Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview) is a library for building autonomous AI agents using Claude Code. You can deploy your Claude Agent SDK projects to Blaxel with minimal code editing (and zero configuration), enabling you to colocate them close to the [sandboxes](/Sandboxes/Overview) the agents work on.
