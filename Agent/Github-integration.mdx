As your project is ready to go to production, a typical way to manage CI/CD for your agents is to synchronize them with a GitHub repo. You can connect a GitHub repository to Blaxel to automatically deploy updates whenever changes are pushed to the *main* branch.

This integration is only available to deploy [agents](Overview).

## Set up GitHub integration

The simplest way to start is connecting your GitHub repository through the Blaxel Console.

Requirements:

- Authenticate with a GitHub account that **shares the same public email address** as your current Blaxel login

This creates a GitHub action in your repository that connects to your Blaxel workspace to automatically launch a deployment when a push is made on the *main* branch.

### Deploy from a specific branch

At the moment, you can only deploy from *main*. Reach out to Blaxel if you need to deploy from other branches.
