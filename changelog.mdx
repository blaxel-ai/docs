### Sandboxes

<Frame>

</Frame>

Our biggest release since we launched: Sandboxes, running on our new Mark 3 Infrastructure!

Sandboxes are fast-launching virtual machines built for agentic AIs. Agents can use them to run commands or render code in an isolated environment.

This protects your infrastructure when running AI-generated code, enabling use cases such as codegen, AI code review, AI data analysis and more.

They are powered by our brand-new Mark 3 infrastructure generation that pushes the limits of infrastructure performance. Key features of Mk 3 sandboxes:

- Boot time under 20ms
- Persistent filesystem across sessions
- Operable via both [Python/TypeScript SDK](Sandboxes/Overview) and MCP server

Sandboxes and Mk 3 infrastructure are currently in private Alpha release. [Contact us](http://blaxel.ai/contact?purpose=sandbox) to get access.
