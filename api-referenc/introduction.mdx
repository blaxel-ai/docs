Blaxel APIs allow you to interact with all resources inside of and across your workspace(s). 

## Get started

Authentication to the Blaxel APIs can either be done using [API keys](../Security/Access-tokens) created from the Blaxel console, or through a [classic OAuth 2.0 flow](../Security/Access-tokens).

**API keys** allow you to get started quickly. Simply [generate an API key](../Security/Access-tokens) for your user or service account and use the API key as a bearer token in place of the authorization headers `Authorization` or `X-Blaxel-Authorization` in any call to the Blaxel APIs. 

For example, to list models:

```
curl 'https://api.blaxel.ai/v0/models' \
  -H 'accept: application/json, text/plain, */*' \
  -H 'X-Blaxel-Authorization: Bearer YOUR-API-KEY'
```

To use **short-lived JWTs**, see [the guide on using an OAuth 2.0 flow](../Security/Access-tokens).
